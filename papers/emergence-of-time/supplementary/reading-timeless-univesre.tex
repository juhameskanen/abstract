\section*{Abstract}
This thought experiment explores the mechanics of time as an observer-relative ordinal within a static informational ensemble.
We derive the perceived arrow of time and the cosmological dynamics of expansion/collapse from the observer's self-location on a universal algorithmic probability landscape.

\section{The Static Ensemble and the Observer's Walk}
Consider a closed, finite informational universe represented by the static Superspace $\mathcal{C}$ (the ensemble of all possible bit-configurations).
Within this ensemble, no fundamental dynamics or temporal evolution exists. We posit that time $t$ is not a property of $\mathcal{C}$, but the \textbf{ordinal index} of an observer's sequential traversal of states:
\begin{equation}
    t = \{0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}
\end{equation}
This "walk" represents the internal ordering imposed by the observer.

\section{Perspectival Arrows and the Selection Principle}
According to the \textbf{Spectral Selection Principle (SSP)}, an observer is exponentially more likely to self-locate along paths of \textbf{Minimal Description Length (MDL)}. The probability of a specific history $H$ is given by the universal distribution:
\begin{equation}
    P(H) \propto 2^{-K(H)}
\end{equation}
where $K(H)$ is the Kolmogorov complexity of the path. The perceived direction of time is thus a filter: observers find themselves on trajectories that maximize algorithmic redundancy and structural persistence.

\section{The Symmetry of Expansion and Collapse}
The perceived dynamics of the universe (Expansion vs. Collapse) are determined by the observer's relative position on the algorithmic probability "hill":

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Left Slope (Low-Entropy Start):} 
    The observer originates in a highly compressible, low-entropy state ($H \approx 0$). As the walk progresses, the configuration space "unfolds," leading to an emergent motif density. The observer perceives an \textbf{expanding universe} with a singularity in the relative past.
    
    \item \textbf{The Right Slope (High-Entropy Start):} 
    The observer originates in a high-entropy region and traverses toward denser, more redundant configurations. The observer perceives a \textbf{collapsing universe} where motifs converge toward a singularity in the relative future.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
Expansion and collapse are not inherent properties of the informational ensemble, but complementary "readings" of the same static object.
The arrow of time is entirely perspectival; it is the geometric manifestation of an observer following the gradient of maximal compressibility.
In this framework, the "Big Bang" and "Black Holes" are symmetric boundary conditions of the informational trace.
