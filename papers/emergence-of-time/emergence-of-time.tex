\title{\textbf{The Algorithmic Universe: A Synthesis of Ontological Equivalence, Wavefunction Compression, and Zero-Entropy Boundaries}}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present a unified theory of everything derived from seven informational pillars. We show that reality is the geometric interpretation of a maximally compressed execution trace. By defining the observer as a formal axiomatic system, we derive the emergence of spacetime from entropy growth and the Born Rule from algorithmic parsimony. Our framework resolves the ultraviolet divergences of QFT and the singularities of General Relativity by identifying them as states of informational exhaustion (zero entropy).

\section{The Axiomatic Foundation}
As established in \textit{Meskanen (2009)}, if a human observer is a formal axiomatic system, reality must be substrate-independent. We define a \textbf{Pre-Reality} $\mathbf{P}$ where nothing is forbidden. Within $\mathbf{P}$, a finite informational structure $\mathcal{C} \cong \{0,1\}^n$ coexists as a static Wheeler-DeWitt superspace. Time is not a fundamental pillar but an emergent ordinal index of the observer’s internal state transitions.

\section{The Principle of Maximal Compression}
According to Solomonoff’s Prior, the probability $P$ of a specific experience is dominated by its Kolmogorov complexity $K$: $P \approx 2^{-K}$. Observers do not inhabit random worlds; they are filtered into the most "probable" subsets of $\mathcal{C}$---those that are maximally compressible. 


\section{The Wavefunction as an Optimal Transform}
We posited that the wavefunction $\Psi$ is the universal compression transform. Simulations (\textit{Meskanen, Dec 2025}) using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on lattice configurations demonstrate that compression-optimal bases naturally reproduce near-unitary evolution and Hermitian generators. The "waving" of reality is the informational equivalent of the Discrete Cosine Transform, providing the most efficient basis for representing the execution trace.


\section{Cosmological Emergence and Singularities}
The universe begins at a zero-entropy boundary ($H=0$), which is the most probable "seed" in the Solomonoff distribution. As entropy increases via bit-flips, spacetime "unfolds" geometrically.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Expansion:} Cosmic expansion is the geometric interpretation of increasing informational entropy.
    \item \textbf{Singularities:} Gravitational singularities (\textit{Meskanen, 2019}) are not points of infinite density but states of informational exhaustion. As configurations approach a singularity, the execution-trace entropy $H(b) \to 0$. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Perspectival Dynamics and the Arrow of Time}
Time is defined as the discrete ordinal index $t \in \mathbb{N}$ of an observer's walk through the configuration space $\mathcal{C}$. We posit that the perceived expansion of the universe is not a global evolution, but a property of the observer's self-location on the "entropy hill." 

Observers self-locating on the low-entropy gradient perceive a "Big Bang" and expansion, while those on the high-entropy gradient perceive a "Black Hole" and collapse. Both are symmetric readings of the same static informational object. The arrow of time is thus an emergent filter: we perceive the direction that maximizes the probability of continued existence through algorithmic redundancy.

\section{The Information-Theoretic Born Rule}
The Born Rule ($p_i = |\psi_i|^2$) is derived as the unique probability measure that preserves the informational integrity of the $2^n$ configurations during the compression-to-experience mapping. Any deviation from the $L^2$ norm introduces algorithmic waste, making such "worlds" exponentially unlikely to be observed.

\section{Suppression of QFT Divergences}
In our "QBitwave" framework, high-frequency modes correspond to incompressible, high-entropy bitstrings. Because these states have maximal $K$, their amplitudes vanish in the universal distribution. This providing a built-in UV-regularization mechanism for QFT integrals without the need for manual counter-terms.


\section{Conclusion: The Geometry of Information}
Physics is the study of the most probable representations of a static informational set. Gravity, time, and matter are not fundamental; they are the geometric interpretations of the algorithmic selection pressure that favors order over chaos. The universe does not deal in infinities because infinities cannot be efficiently stored or propagated.
