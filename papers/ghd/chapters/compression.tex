\chapter{Spectral Complexity and Induction}

\section{Kolmogorov Complexity and Algorithmic Induction}

Algorithmic Kolmogorov complexity, while mathematically elegant, is ill-suited as a physical primitive. 
It is uncomputable, discontinuous, and defined only relative to symbolic machines. 
Physical systems, by contrast, evolve continuously, and any measure of description length must reflect this continuity. 

In this work, we replace Kolmogorov complexity with \emph{spectral complexity}, defined as the number and distribution of modes required to represent observer-relevant information. 

\section{Spectral Complexity}

Spectral complexity is continuous, computable, and naturally aligned with physical representations such as wavefunctions and fields. 
Smooth, low-bandwidth descriptions dominate the space of stable observer histories, providing a physically grounded basis for induction without invoking abstract computation.

Spectral complexity is a compression principle, not a computation principle. 
It concerns the measure over representations, not execution on any substrate: 

Brains do not execute algorithms; neural networks do not “run code”; intelligence is not a step-by-step symbolic procedure. 
Biological and artificial neural networks are continuous, distributed, massively parallel dynamical systems. 

For example, no “for loop” runs in one’s head when seeing that $2+2=4$ or imagining a smooth circle. 
And yet structure is recognized, compression occurs, and prediction is possible. 
Compression is therefore embodied in structure, not performed as a procedure.

\section{Induction as Passive Selection}

Induction in this framework is not something observers actively perform. 
It is a combinatorial consequence of the distribution of possible histories. 

Returning to the movie library analogy: observers do not select, evaluate, or rank movies. 
Instead, one simply finds oneself inside a particular movie. 
The only reason some movies dominate is that there are vastly more compressed descriptions encoding smooth, stable observer histories than there are descriptions encoding chaotic, unstructured ones that preserve observer identity. 

This is passive selection, not active inference. 
Existence, multiplicity, and measure suffice to explain why observers find themselves in highly structured, predictable worlds. 

Intelligence feels effortless because compression is already embodied in the structure of the world. 
We see smooth circles without computing Fourier series, we know $2+2=4$, and neural networks recognize patterns without explicit rules.

\section{Implications}

The wavefunction is already the compressed form; geometry enforces stable boundaries; and discreteness limits resolution. 
Observers are born into these compressed, discretized, geometrically filtered worlds—they do not perform compression themselves. 

Smooth, predictable worlds dominate observer measure because they admit maximal compression while preserving observer identity. 
Spectral complexity therefore provides a physically grounded replacement for algorithmic Kolmogorov complexity and underlies the emergence of lawful, comprehensible physics.
