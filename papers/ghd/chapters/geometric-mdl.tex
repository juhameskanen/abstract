\section{Minimum Description Length Functional}

We interpret spacetime geometry as a compression model for worldline and field data.
The optimal geometry minimizes total description length:

\begin{equation}
C_{\mathrm{total}}[g;\Phi]
=
C_G[g]
+
C_Q[\Phi \mid g],
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{align}
C_G[g]
&=
\alpha \int R \, \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x, \\
C_Q[\Phi \mid g]
&=
\beta \int \mathcal{L}_\text{matter}[\Phi, g] \, \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x.
\end{align}

Here:

\begin{itemize}
\item $C_G[g]$ is the geometric encoding cost (spacetime curvature), given by the **Einstein–Hilbert action**,
\item $C_Q[\Phi \mid g]$ is the conditional encoding cost of matter or fields $\Phi$ given the geometry $g$,
\item $R$ is the Ricci scalar curvature of the metric $g$,
\item $\sqrt{-g}\,d^4x$ is the invariant spacetime volume element.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Remark:} This functional is fully nonlinear and covariant. It reduces to the weak-field quadratic proxy $\int (\partial g)^2$ only in the linearized approximation.


\section{Variation with Respect to Matter / Worldlines}

Minimizing $C_Q[\Phi \mid g]$ with respect to matter degrees of freedom $\Phi$ yields the **classical equations of motion** for the fields:

\begin{equation}
\delta_\Phi C_Q = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad
\frac{\delta (\mathcal{L}_\text{matter} \sqrt{-g})}{\delta \Phi} = 0.
\end{equation}

- For point particles, this reproduces the geodesic equation.
- For continuous fields (scalar, electromagnetic, fluid), it yields the usual **Euler-Lagrange equations** in curved spacetime.
- Conceptually, these are the **minimal conditional encoding trajectories** or configurations for matter given the geometry.



\section{Variation with Respect to Geometry}

Varying the total functional with respect to the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ gives:

\begin{equation}
\delta C_{\mathrm{total}} = \delta C_G + \delta C_Q = 0.
\end{equation}

- The geometric term variation yields:

\begin{equation}
\delta C_G = \alpha \int G_{\mu\nu} \, \delta g^{\mu\nu} \, \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x,
\end{equation}

where $G_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} R$ is the **Einstein tensor**.  

- The matter term variation yields the **stress-energy tensor**:

\begin{equation}
\delta C_Q = -\frac{\beta}{2} \int T_{\mu\nu} \, \delta g^{\mu\nu} \, \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x, \quad
T_{\mu\nu} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}} \frac{\delta (\mathcal{L}_\text{matter} \sqrt{-g})}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}}.
\end{equation}

Setting \(\delta C_\text{total} = 0\) yields the **full Einstein field equations**:

\begin{equation}
G_{\mu\nu} = \kappa T_{\mu\nu}, \quad
\kappa = \frac{\beta}{\alpha}.
\end{equation}

- No linearization is required; the equations are fully nonlinear and valid for arbitrary spacetime curvature and matter distributions.



\section{Interpretation in MDL Terms}

In this framework:

\begin{itemize}
\item $C_G[g]$ represents the **description length of the geometry itself**.
\item $C_Q[\Phi \mid g]$ represents the **description length of matter or field configurations given the geometry**.
\item Minimizing $C_\text{total}$ finds the **optimal compression of spacetime and matter histories**.
\end{itemize}

This is a **direct generalization** of the spectral / wavefunction MDL argument from quantum mechanics to the full gravitational case.



\section{Remarks and Extensions}

\begin{itemize}
\item This derivation is now **fully covariant** and includes **nonlinear effects**.
\item Point-particle models are a special case; the same framework accommodates **continuous fields**.
\item The analogy to your QM chapter remains: just as low spectral complexity histories dominate the wavefunction measure, low-geometric-complexity spacetime configurations dominate the MDL measure.
\item The principle naturally explains **geodesic motion, energy-momentum conservation, and the Einstein field equations** as outcomes of information-theoretic optimality.
\end{itemize}



\section{Conclusion}

By interpreting spacetime and matter as MDL-encoded informational structures:

\begin{itemize}
\item Geodesics emerge from **conditional matter encoding**,
\item Full Einstein equations emerge from **geometry encoding**,
\item Nonlinear GR arises naturally as the **optimal compression of histories in spacetime**.
\end{itemize}
