\section{Advances in Science}

During the past centuries, physics has achieved remarkable success in unifying a large number of partial theories into two powerful frameworks: Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity. The equations in both theories match all observations with remarkable precision, limited only by current technological capabilities. Those capabilities themselves have reached a level that would have seemed almost inconceivable only a few decades ago.

Space-based observatories such as the James Webb Space Telescope now directly image the early universe,
resolving infrared signals emitted only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. Its operation
depends simultaneously on quantum optics, relativistic orbital mechanics, and nanometer-scale wavefront
control, turning cosmological theory itself into an engineering requirement.

At the opposite extreme, global interferometric arrays such as the Event Horizon Telescope resolve
horizon-scale structure around black holes, directly probing the geometry of spacetime in the
strong-field regime predicted by general relativity.

Gravitational-wave observatories such as LIGO can detect distortions of spacetime smaller than a proton’s diameter, measuring relative changes in length caused by distant black-hole mergers billions of light-years away. Atomic clocks, exploiting the quantum structure of atoms, now keep time so precisely that they would lose or gain less than a second over the age of the universe, and are sensitive enough to register differences in gravitational potential corresponding to changes in height of mere centimeters.

Elsewhere, quantum electrodynamics predicts the magnetic moment of the electron to a precision verified to many decimal places, making it one of the most accurately tested theories in all of science. Interferometers routinely resolve wavelengths far smaller than the structures they probe, while particle accelerators recreate conditions not seen since the earliest moments after the Big Bang. Even the global positioning systems that guide everyday navigation rely on relativistic corrections so precise that neglecting them would lead to kilometer-scale errors within a single day.

Comparable advances span quantum control experiments (Bose–Einstein condensates and quantum simulators),
neutrino observatories (IceCube, Super-Kamiokande), and precision cosmology (Planck, ACT, SPT).

The theoretical descriptions of nature have become so accurate that reality itself now serves as the experimental apparatus for testing them. Physical law is no longer merely inferred from observation; it is continuously confirmed, corrected, and operationalized by technologies that depend on its validity to function at all. The theories have escaped the confines of paper and chalk and become embedded in the technological fabric of modern civilization. An obvious example is computation. From the quantum-mechanical behavior of transistors to the relativistic corrections required for satellite navigation, our deepest physical theories now operate continuously and invisibly inside machines that process information at planetary scale. Computation is no longer merely a tool for studying nature; it has become a physical process in its own right, governed by energy constraints, thermodynamics, noise, and quantum limits.

This trajectory has culminated in the rise of artificial intelligence systems of unprecedented complexity. These systems are not programmed in the traditional sense but are shaped through optimization processes that resemble physical evolution more than logical deduction. Trained on vast datasets and executed on hardware operating near fundamental physical limits, they exhibit behaviors—learning, abstraction, and generalization—that were once considered exclusively biological. Remarkably, their success does not rely on new physical laws, but on exploiting known ones at scale, transforming raw energy into structured information with extraordinary efficiency.

While many of the most sophisticated scientific instruments ever built serve no immediate practical
purpose beyond testing fundamental laws of nature, science has also been remarkably productive in
more everyday domains. Smartphones, global navigation systems, AI-enhanced electric toothbrushes, not to mention 
nuclear weapons now permeate daily life. 

Science has much to celebrate. 


\section{The Elusive Theory of Everything}

Given this extraordinary convergence between theory, experiment, and technology, it would be natural to expect that the final unification of physical law is close at hand.

Following the success of unifying partial theories into two grand pillars—General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Mechanics (QM)—it appeared certain that the unification process would eventually reach the ultimate goal of physics: a Theory of Everything. This would be a single equation capable of describing the entire universe. To date, however, this has not happened. Despite overwhelming evidence supporting both theories, they remain fundamentally incompatible in their current formulations. And while empirical disagreement may signal the need for refinement, mathematical inconsistency is decisive: a theory that is internally inconsistent cannot be a fundamental description of nature.

Historically, most attempts at unification assume that the quantum description is more fundamental, so it is General Relativity that should be modified, because everything else has already been quantized. Matter fields—electrons, photons, quarks—all obey quantum field theory. Spacetime might simply be another field awaiting quantization, and several facts appear to support this view.

First, GR breaks down at small scales. Near singularities or at the Planck length, curvature appear to become infinite. This signals a failure of the continuum picture, not of quantum mechanics. The intuition is therefore to quantize gravity to remove these divergences, just as quantizing electromagnetism resolved the ultraviolet catastrophe.

However, despite decades of research, no single framework has yet succeeded in combining the principles of quantum mechanics with the geometric description of spacetime provided by General Relativity. Attempts at unification—most notably string theory—have become so intricate that the complexity itself now poses the greatest challenge. In effect, we have constructed a rock too heavy even for its creators to lift.


\subsection{Semiclassical Gravity}

One of the earliest attempts to bridge the quantum--classical divide is \emph{semiclassical gravity}. In this approach, matter is treated as fully quantum, while spacetime remains classical. To make the Einstein field equations workable, the operator-valued stress--energy tensor of quantum matter is replaced by its expectation value—the renormalized average of the energy and momentum calculated over the quantum state of the matter fields. This resulting set of ordinary numbers can then be inserted into the equations governing curvature.

Semiclassical gravity is remarkably successful. It accurately describes a wide range of phenomena, from laboratory experiments to astrophysical observations and cosmology. It even predicts striking effects such as Hawking radiation in black holes. Yet its very success also exposes its conceptual limitation: the approach is \emph{ad hoc}. Spacetime geometry is treated as classical while matter is quantum. The theory works well for everything we can observe, but it does not answer any of the deeper question, like what is the physics at the sigularity of a black hole.

\subsection{Perturbative Quantum Gravity}

A natural next step is \emph{perturbative quantum gravity}, where spacetime is expanded around a simple background—typically flat or slightly curved—and the perturbations are treated as quantum fields. This approach is conceptually straightforward and extends the familiar machinery of quantum field theory to gravity.

However, it quickly runs into a fundamental problem: gravity is \emph{nonrenormalizable}. Unlike the Standard Model, where infinities in quantum corrections can be controlled through renormalization, attempts to remove infinities in perturbative quantum gravity fail. The equations produce uncontrolled divergences, and no systematic procedure yields finite, predictive results. The techniques that work spectacularly well for matter fields simply break down for spacetime itself.

\subsection{Nonperturbative and Geometric Approaches}

In response to the failure of perturbative quantization, researchers have developed nonperturbative frameworks that do not assume a fixed background geometry. A leading example is Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), which models spacetime as a discrete combinatorial structure of spin networks. LQG is mathematically rigorous and fully background-independent, offering a conceptually clean quantization of geometry.

However, it seems major obstacles still remain. Deriving a smooth classical spacetime limit is nontrivial, and embedding standard particle physics into the LQG framework remains unresolved. 


\subsection{String Theory: A rock too heavy}

In string theory, point particles are replaced by one-dimensional strings. Gravity emerges as one of the vibrational modes of the string, and the framework unifies all fundamental forces in principle. String theory deals with deep mathematical and abstract structures, dualities, extra dimensions, black-hole entropy counting, just to name a few.

However, significant challenges remain also with the string theory. It relies on supersymmetry, which has not been observed experimentally. The theory admits an enormous landscape of possible vacuum states—often estimated at around $10^{500}$—raising concerns about predictivity and falsifiability. Extra spatial dimensions are required, typically assumed to be compactified at extremely small scales, yet they remain empirically undetected. Direct experimental tests of string-scale physics are effectively out of reach.

Also, one might ask what a theory as flexible as string theory is good for. Ask any question and one of those $10^{500}$ worlds include the answer. A theory sufficiently flexible to accommodate all observations risks explaining none. 

\subsection{Emergent and Holographic Approaches}

A more radical class of ideas treats gravity and spacetime as emergent rather than fundamental. This perspective arose from puzzles at the intersection of gravity, thermodynamics, and quantum theory. Black holes behave as thermodynamic objects, possessing entropy proportional to horizon area and emitting thermal radiation. These results suggest a deep link between geometry, information, and statistical mechanics.

The observation that gravitational entropy scales with area rather than volume led to the holographic principle: the idea that the degrees of freedom of a region of spacetime may be encoded on its boundary. Holographic dualities further support this view, showing that spacetime geometry and gravitational dynamics can emerge from nongravitational quantum theories.

\subsubsection{From Geometry to Bitstring}

The holographic principle argues that a three-dimensional universe can be described by a two-dimensional theory ($N \rightarrow N-1$). This is actually quite surprising result.
Everything that happens in the universe (whether it had four dimensions or eleveven, can be described by its $N-1$ dimensional surface. However, If $3D$ can map to $2D$, why stop there?

In software architecture, any $N$-dimensional space is ultimately stored as a one-dimensional bitstring ($N \rightarrow 1$). A sequence of bits has no intrinsic geometry; width and height are formatting conventions imposed by interpretation. Following this logic to its conclusion, the universe may be fundamentally dimensionless. Space, curvature, and connectivity are rendering modes of a one-dimensional sequence of axiomatic instructions.


\subsection{The Simulation Hypothesis: Reality as Software}

During recent years so-called Simulation Hypothesis has become increasingly popular. If the universe is fundamentally informational, it is tempting to conclude that we are merely a program running on some higher-order "hardware." In this view, the strange "quantization" of our world is simply the resolution of the grid, and the speed of light is the clock-speed of the processor.

However, the simulation hypothesis feels like a philosophical "shell game." It merely translates the mystery of existence by one level: if we are a simulation, who simulated the simulators? Furthermore, it ignores the staggering Information Cost of reality.

Consider the entropy of a single human being. To simulate even a single strand of DNA with perfect fidelity requires tracking billions of quantum interactions. To harvest enough information from a "parent universe" to simulate an entire "child universe" would require a thermodynamic overhead that seems unsustainable.

Perhaps the most human explanation, familiar to any software engineer, is this: the universe is running on legacy code.
In this view, the fundamental incompatibility between the smooth, geometric curves of GR and the discrete, probabilistic jumps of QM is not a profound mystery of nature, but a design bug. We often assume a "Theory of Everything" must be an elegant, unified masterpiece, but real-world software is rarely that clean. It is often a patchwork of modules written by different people, at different times, with different goals. Maybe, we are
living in simulation.


\section{The Deeper Problem}

\subsection{Unexplained Assumptions}

In addition to the difficulties of finding a unified Theory of Everything, there is an even more serious problem: all candidate theories rely on unexplained assumptions. This incompleteness can be expressed as
\[
\text{ToE}_{\text{incomplete}} = \text{ToE}_{\text{complete}} \setminus \mathcal{A},
\]
where $\mathcal{A}$ denotes the set of fundamental assumptions left unexplained, such as the number of dimensions, constants, or the nature of spacetime itself.

General Relativity assumes that spacetime exists but says nothing about its underlying composition.
Quantum Field Theory assumes the existence of fields along with a large number of experimentally determined constants.
String Theory assumes extra compactified dimensions and an enormous landscape of possible vacua.

\subsection{The Role of Observations}

Physical theories must ultimately be tested against observation. Without falsifiable consequences, a framework belongs more to philosophy than physics.

Many mainstream physical theories treat the observer as external, assuming that the universe exists independently of anyone observing it. Yet observation and experience are the only way the universe is ever known.

Since the early days of quantum mechanics, the role of the observer has been a source of deep unease. Einstein famously objected to interpretations that appeared to grant observation a fundamental role, asking whether the Moon itself would cease to exist when no one looked at it. Bohr, in contrast, maintained that physics is not a description of nature as it is, but a framework for organizing what can be said about observations.

Nearly a century later, this tension remains unresolved. Most physical theories are still formulated as if observers were external to the universe they describe, despite the fact that every physical statement ultimately originates from observation, memory, and inference. These unexplained assumptions are compounded by the fact that observation itself is rarely treated as part of the formalism.

A genuinely complete Theory of Everything should explain everything—including us intelligent (well, more or less) observers.
