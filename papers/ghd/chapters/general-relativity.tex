\chapter{Why General Relativity?}

\section{Curved Spacetime and Gravity}

We don't find ourselves living in high dimensional Hilbert space as complex valued Fourier frequencies and phases. What
we sense is three dimensional space that constantly changes with time according to something that we call gravity. 

According to General Relativity, gravity is not a force in the traditional sense. 
Instead, matter and energy curve spacetime, and objects follow the paths dictated by that curvature. 
In Einstein’s equation:

\begin{equation}
G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}

the distribution of mass–energy $T_{\mu\nu}$ determines the curvature $G_{\mu\nu}$, 
which in turn governs the motion of all objects.

Space and time are not absolute backgrounds. Each observer measures intervals 
according to their local trajectory through curved spacetime. 
The future is embedded in the four-dimensional geometry, though not all events are 
accessible to a given observer.

A thought experiment makes this concrete. Imagine an observer in orbit around a black hole, 
and consider a hypothetical object falling toward the event horizon. 
From the distant observer's perspective, the object slows as it approaches the horizon, 
never seeming to cross it. To the falling object, however, the rest of the universe 
appears to accelerate: billions of years may pass outside while only seconds elapse locally.

This difference is not a quirk. It is a structural feature of spacetime. 
Time is observer-dependent, and gravitational fields stretch or compress 
the rate at which events are experienced.

General Relativity replaces force with geometry. 
But this geometric reformulation raises a deeper question:

Why geometry at all?

\section{Singularities}

Geometry can get extreme forms.  Highly concentrated mass–energy can curve spacetime so intensely that curvature formally diverges—a singularity. 
In classical GR, such singularities signal breakdown of the spacetime manifold. 
The equations predict them, yet cease to describe them.

From a purely geometric standpoint, this appears pathological. We live in four dimensional spacetime, which appears to break
down every here and there, namely at the centers of black holes and the big-bang itself - the singularity that appears
to be the origin of everything.

Let us investigate black hole singularities by treating a computer simulation 
and the simulated black hole as two equivalent descriptions of the same informational structure.

The question is not whether GR predicts singularities—it does. 
The question is whether the informational description clarifies what they represent.

\section{Execution Trace}

In software engineering, an execution trace is the chronological record of all machine states during program execution. 
If source code is a map, the execution trace is the complete GPS log of every step taken.

Building on the equivalence between physical and informational configurations established earlier, 
we treat spacetime geometry and execution trace as two interpretations of the same underlying structure.

Where GR becomes numerically unstable near singularity formation, 
the execution trace remains well-defined. 
This provides complementary access to the collapse process.

Let $\mathcal{M}$ denote the set of all memory locations in a deterministic computing system. 
A \emph{machine state} $\mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{M}$ is a complete assignment of values to all memory elements. 
Let $\mathcal{P} = (I_1, I_2, \dots, I_n)$ be a finite sequence of deterministic instructions, 
with $I_k : \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}$. 

The execution trace $\mathcal{T}$ is the ordered sequence:

\[
\mathcal{T} = (s_0, s_1, \dots, s_n), \quad s_{k+1} = I_{k+1}(s_k).
\]

The trace encodes the full informational evolution of the simulated geometry.

\subsection{Mapping Geometry to Bitstring}

Let a geometric configuration be encoded as a bitstring $b \in \{0,1\}^L$, 
representing discretized particle positions in a collapsing dust cloud. 
Define the configuration space:

\[
C = \{0,1\}^{3k}.
\]

Let

\[
f : C \to \mathbb{Z}^3,
\]

decode fixed-length binary segments into integer coordinates. 
Quantization ensures that entropy reflects genuine positional distinctions.

\subsection{Shannon Entropy}

The Shannon entropy of the bitstring is

\[
H(b) = -p_0 \log_2 p_0 - p_1 \log_2 p_1,
\]

where $p_0$ and $p_1$ are empirical bit frequencies.

Across the execution trace, entropy decreases monotonically as particles converge.

Although the geometric simulation crashes numerically at the classical singularity 
due to divergences, the entropy trajectory extrapolates smoothly:

\[
H(\mathcal{B}_t) \to 0.
\]

Zero entropy implies $W = 1$: only one distinguishable configuration remains.

Any faithful geometric decoding of a zero-entropy bitstring yields the same object: a point.

Thus the singularity is not an infinite curvature region, but a state of informational exhaustion. 
It is the simplest possible geometric configuration.

\section{General Relativity as Information Compression}

We now return to the broader question.

Why does gravity manifest as curvature? Why does spacetime possess this structure?

One answer is efficiency.

General Relativity acts as an extreme data compression scheme. Take any amount of energy and matter,
and the Einstein field equations map the enormously complex distribution of its
microscopic degrees of freedom into a single geometric object: the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$.

Instead of tracking all particle interactions, the theory encodes their collective 
informational content into curvature.

Symbolically:

\[
\text{Information density} \longrightarrow \text{Curvature}.
\]

Many microstates correspond to the same macroscopic geometry. 
The metric acts as a minimal sufficient statistic of stress–energy.

This is compression.



\section{Why Three Spatial Dimensions?}

We now address the central question:

Why do we experience three spatial dimensions instead of 
an abstract high-dimensional Hilbert space?

An observer is a self-maintaining information structure. 
To persist, three conditions must hold:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Internal information must remain stable and predictable.
\item External interaction must be highly regulated, we cannot let information in us leak out, dissolve or get mixed.
\item We need well defined informational boundaries that separate ``inside'' from ``outside''.
\end{enumerate}

Boundaries require volume.

In one spatial dimension, closed boundaries cannot enclose anything.  
In two dimensions, enclosed regions exist but physical fields decay too slowly 
(for example, gravitational potential scales logarithmically rather than as $1/r$), 
making stable isolation fragile.

In three spatial dimensions, several familiar yet crucial properties emerge:

\begin{itemize}
\item Inverse-square force laws ($F \propto 1/r^2$),
\item Stable bound orbits,
\item Finite-energy localized field configurations,
\item Closed surfaces that enclose volume.
\end{itemize}

A 2-sphere embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ encloses volume. 
That volume separates interior from exterior.

Without such separation, information would diffuse without constraint.

Dimensional analysis of gravity supports this. 
In $D$ spacetime dimensions, Newtonian potential scales as

\[
\Phi(r) \propto \frac{1}{r^{D-3}}.
\]

Stable planetary orbits exist only in $D = 4$ spacetime dimensions (3 spatial).  
For $D > 4$, forces decay too rapidly to produce stable closed orbits.  
For $D < 4$, gravitational dynamics lack propagating degrees of freedom.

Thus $3+1$ dimensions represent the minimal setting in which:

\begin{itemize}
\item Gravity propagates dynamically,
\item Bound systems are stable,
\item Information structures can remain isolated.
\end{itemize}

We do not experience Hilbert space directly because it lacks intrinsic 
geometric boundaries. It does not define interior versus exterior.

Geometric spacetime does.


\section{Geometry and Survival}

Biological observers possess sharply defined boundaries. 
Even minor disruptions threaten survival. 
Pain itself functions as an informational protection system.

If we were diffuse wave-like structures without geometric containment, 
persistent intelligence would be impossible, just like any information in clouds would be blown
away by slightest turbulence.

Well-defined boundaries prevent destructive mixing of relevant and irrelevant information.

Spacetime geometry provides:

\begin{itemize}
\item Locality,
\item Causal order,
\item Boundary formation,
\item Controlled information exchange.
\end{itemize}

These are prerequisites for observers. These allow sense of self, better survival based on logical reasoning.
Something we humans are good with.

\section{Conclusions}

Three spatial dimensions and one time dimension is minimal requirements of stable boundaries and localized information.
It is the simplest geometric encoding of information that allows  persistent informational structures to exist.

Why does spacetime curve? 

Because General Relativity encodes mass–energy into curvature. It is a geometric compression scheme.
