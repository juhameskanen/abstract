\section{The Time-Reversed Black Hole}

In the previous chapter, we established that vanishing Shannon entropy in an execution trace corresponds to geometric collapse. 
When all bits are identical, no distinction exists between one ``location'' and another; the induced spacetime representation converges to a single point. 
In General Relativity, this limit resembles complete gravitational compression.

If entropy collapse corresponds to geometric compression, the converse also holds: increasing entropy corresponds to geometric unfolding. 
This is not an additional hypothesis but a direct consequence of the entropy–geometry equivalence. 
Collapse and expansion are simply opposite directions in the same informational configuration space. 
Cosmic expansion can therefore be understood as the time-reversed analogue of black hole formation: it is not an explosion of matter into a pre-existing container, 
but the progressive differentiation of information manifesting geometrically as increasing spatial separation.

\section{Entropy as a Driver of Expansion}

\subsection{Geometric Particle Filter}

Consider an execution trace
\[
S_t \in \{0,1\}^L, \quad t = 0, \dots, n,
\]
with fixed length $L$. We initialize the system at a state of zero Shannon entropy,
\[
S_0 = (0,0,\dots,0),
\]
which we identify with the informational singularity.

As the system evolves through random bit-flip mutations, its Shannon entropy
\[
H(S_t) = - \sum_{b \in \{0,1\}} p_t(b)\log_2 p_t(b)
\]
increases.

To obtain a geometric representation, we introduce a decoding map
\[
D : \{0,1\}^L \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3,
\]
which assigns subsets of bits to spatial coordinates. This induces a discrete spacetime fabric on which structural filters are defined:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Elementary particles:} Pairs of spatial points whose separation is below a some threshold.
    \item \textbf{Atoms:} Triplets of points forming tight, approximately equilateral triangles.
    \item \textbf{Molecules:} Clusters of atoms whose geometric centers lie within a small separation threshold.
\end{itemize}

Even in this minimal model, two robust features emerge:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Spontaneous hierarchical organization.}  
    As entropy increases, bits cluster into higher-order structures without explicit rules for hierarchy.
    \item \textbf{Local stability amid global expansion.}  
    Bound structures remain coherent due to informational redundancy, while the average separation between clusters grows with entropy. 
\end{enumerate}

This mirrors an essential feature of cosmology: gravitationally bound systems do not expand with the Hubble flow, whereas large-scale distances increase.

Among the $2^L$ possible bit configurations, the zero-entropy state occupies measure zero. 
Maximal entropy corresponds to near-complete randomness, which cannot support stable structures. Observers therefore require an intermediate regime:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Low Entropy:} No distinguishable structure; geometry collapses to a point.
    \item \textbf{High Entropy:} No persistence; configurations fluctuate randomly.
    \item \textbf{Intermediate Entropy:} Hierarchical structures emerge and remain coherent while the global geometry unfolds.
\end{itemize}

\section{Open Problems}

This framework raises fundamental questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Gravity Problem:}  
    By what mechanism do emergent informational structures generate effective attractive behavior analogous to gravitation?

    \item \textbf{The Boltzmann Brain Problem:}  
    Why does the informational ensemble favor large, lawful universes over isolated, short-lived fluctuations?

    \item \textbf{The Lawfulness Problem:}  
    Why does large-scale smoothness and predictability emerge rather than persistent chaos?
\end{itemize}

These questions delineate the boundary between structural emergence and dynamical explanation.

\section{Conclusion}

Geometric collapse and geometric expansion are dual aspects of the same informational principle. 

Compression occurs when entropy vanishes.  
Unfolding occurs when entropy increases.

The expanding universe may thus be interpreted as an execution trace evolving away from informational homogeneity toward combinatorial richness. 
What appears physically as cosmological expansion corresponds, at a deeper level, to the progressive differentiation of information.
