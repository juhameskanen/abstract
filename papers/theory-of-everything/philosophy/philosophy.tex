\section*{Philosophical Grounding}

A Theory of Everything must be self-contained; any theory predicated upon empirical assumptions is merely a subset.

If a theory $T$ requires an external constraint $S$ to define its constants or boundaries, or if it fails to account for $O$ us—conscious observers—it remains incomplete.

\[
T + S \neq T
\]
\[
T - O \neq T
\]

Is the universe finite or infinite? If it were finite, the source and specific value of that constraint (e.g., "Why N bits and not N+1?") would require a meta-theory to explain.
To avoid an infinite regress of constraints, we must conclude that the fundamental nature of reality is unbounded and infinite.

Why is there something rather than nothing? The most rational answer is that "nothingness" is but one unique configuration among an infinite ensemble of possibilities.
Within an infinite potential, the mathematical probability of absolute non-existence is zero.

Therefore, the fundamental nature of reality is probabilistic and random.
The lawful predictable universe is the most probable outcome in which conscious observers are likely to find themselves.
