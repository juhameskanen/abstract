\section{Dimensional Optimality of Observer Boundaries}


Why three space dimensions?

\begin{lemma}[Dimensional Optimality of Observer Boundaries]
Let $D$ be an execution trace representing a bounded, persistent observer. Consider the set of all geometric encodings $G_d$ of $D$ in $d$ spatial dimensions. Let $L(G_d)$ denote the minimal description length (MDL) required to encode both the observer's interior and its boundary $\partial \Omega_d$. Then the total description length satisfies:
\[
L(G_2) > L_{\min}^\text{obs} \quad \text{(insufficient capacity for stable boundaries)}
\]
\[
L(G_3) = \min_d L(G_d)
\]
\[
L(G_4) > L(G_3) \quad \text{(superlinear boundary cost)}
\]
Consequently, under the MDL-induced measure 
\[
\mu(G_d) \propto e^{-L(G_d)},
\] 
three-dimensional geometric encodings dominate, and observers are overwhelmingly likely to be embedded in three spatial dimensions.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}[Sketch]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Boundary scaling:} In $d$ dimensions, the observer boundary is $(d-1)$-dimensional. Let $R$ denote a characteristic linear size of the observer. The approximate encoding cost of the boundary scales as:
    \[
    L_\text{boundary}(d) \sim C \cdot R^{\,d-1}.
    \]
    This dominates the total encoding cost for higher $d$ due to superlinear growth of boundary complexity.
    
    \item \textbf{Lower dimensions insufficient:} In $d=2$, boundaries are 1D curves. Topological fragility, self-intersections, and insufficient degrees of freedom prevent stable encoding of persistent, localized structures. Consequently, $L(G_2)$ is effectively infinite for complex observers.

    \item \textbf{Optimality in three dimensions:} In $d=3$, boundaries are 2D surfaces. These surfaces admit sufficient topological and geometric flexibility to encode observer interiors with minimal redundancy while maintaining stability and locality. Hence, $L(G_3)$ is minimal among all $d$.

    \item \textbf{Measure dominance:} Under the MDL-induced measure,
    \[
    \mu(G_d) \propto e^{-L(G_d)},
    \]
    the measure is exponentially concentrated on $d=3$, making three-dimensional geometric encodings overwhelmingly probable for observers.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

MDL-weighted measures overwhelmingly favor 3D observer-compatible geometries. Higher-dimensional encodings exist but are exponentially suppressed in the measure.
