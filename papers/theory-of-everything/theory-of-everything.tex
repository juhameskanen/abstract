\title{The Principle of Minimal Informational Strain: \\ A Zero-Parameter Theory of Emergent Physics}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present an informational ontology where physical laws emerge from observer-conditioned typicality. 
Reality is formalized as a static $n$-bit substrate, from which quantum mechanics ($\psi$) and general relativity ($G$) arise as dual, optimal compression channels. 
We demonstrate that the observer's realized history is determined by the joint minimization of spectral and geometric complexity. 
This "Dual-Compression" framework implies that $\psi$ and $G$ are not fundamental, but are the most efficient coordinate systems for maintaining observer coherence. 
We solve the measure problem by identifying a self-organized critical parameter $\lambda_c$, effectively collapsing all apparent free parameters to zero.

\section{Ontological Premises: The Static Bit-Space}

\subsection{Fundamental Information Space}
Reality is a static informational totality $\mathcal{C} = \{0,1\}^n$. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Configuration Space:} All $2^n$ configurations exist simultaneously and timelessly.
    \item \textbf{Ordered Traversals:} A history $\gamma$ is an ordered path through bit-space. All possible paths exist; however, the sampling measure is non-uniform.
    \item \textbf{The Observer:} An observer is a localized informational substructure that maintains internal coherence and persistent memory across a history $\gamma$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Induced Dynamics and Time}
Time is not an ontological primitive but a coordinate internal to the compressed representation of a path. 
Causality emerges because histories with low-complexity transitions are exponentially more probable than chaotic ones.

\section{Dual-Compression Channels}

We propose that physics is the result of the observer mapping raw bit-string histories onto two primary, complementary compression channels.

\subsection{Spectral Complexity}
Microscopic correlations are most efficiently compressed via a spectral representation. 
We define the complexity $C_Q$ as a Sobolev-type seminorm:
\begin{equation}
    C_Q[\gamma] = \sum_{k} k_{\text{eff}}^2 |A_k|^2
\end{equation}
where $k_{\text{eff}}$ is the minimal frequency distance. 
This functional penalizes high-frequency "roughness." 
The wavefunction $\psi$ is thus the minimal smooth encoding of discrete informational structure. 
Quantum behavior (interference, superposition) emerges because Fourier-like modes are the optimal basis for microscopic data compression.

\subsection{Geometric Complexity}
Macroscopic relational structure is compressed via geometry. 
Unlike the Einstein-Hilbert action, the informational cost must be positive-definite to ensure vacuum stability. 
We employ a quadratic Ricci functional:
\begin{equation}
    C_G[\gamma] = \alpha \int R^2 \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x + \beta \int \|a + \Gamma(v,v)\|^2 ds
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{$R^2$ Penalty:} Ensures all curvature costs information, preventing "negative information" instabilities.
    \item \textbf{Geodesic Enforcement:} Deviations from geodesics increase the description length of a path, forcing observers to perceive "inertial" motion.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Universal Informational Measure}

The probability $\mathbb{P}$ of an observer history $\gamma$ is determined by the joint minimization of spectral, geometric, and interaction complexity:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{P}(\gamma \mid O) = \frac{1}{Z_O} \exp \Big[ -\lambda_c \big( C_Q(\gamma) + C_G(\gamma) + C_{\text{int}}(\gamma, G) \big) \Big]
\end{equation}

\subsection{The Self-Organized Criticality of Lamda}
The parameter $\lambda$ weights the "stiffness" of the laws of physics. 
We posit that $\lambda$ is fixed at a critical value $\lambda_c$ representing a phase transition between chaos and crystalline order. 
Only at $\lambda_c$ can "intelligent" observers exist who are complex enough to record history but simple enough to remain predictable. 
Thus, $\lambda$ is an emergent property of the observer's existence, not a free constant.

\subsection{Emergent Gravity via Coupling}
Gravity is the necessary coupling between the two compression channels. 
The interaction term represents the informational cost of mapping a wavefunction $\psi$ onto a manifold $G$:
\begin{equation}
    C_{\text{int}} \sim \int |\psi|^2 R \, \sqrt{-g} \, dV
\end{equation}
Variation of the total functional with respect to the metric yields field equations where curvature responds to spectral density. 
Gravity is not a force; it is the geometric "warping" required to minimize the total global compression cost of an informational structure.

\section{Intelligence and Survival as MDL Optimization}

A potential tension exists between "minimal complexity" and the "complex action" of intelligent agents. 
We resolve this by observing that "death" (entropic dissolution) represents a transition to a high-entropy, high-frequency state. 
In the spectral domain, the dissolution of a coherent observer costs an astronomical amount of informational "bits" ($\sum k^2 |A|^2$ spikes as $\psi$ fragments).

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Intelligence:} The strategic expenditure of local complexity to avoid global informational decoherence.
    \item \textbf{Active Inference:} An intelligent observer selects paths that minimize the \emph{integrated} complexity over future horizons. 
    Swimming against a current to avoid a waterfall is the most probable path because the "cost of swimming" is lower than the "cost of fragmentation."
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

The universe is the path of least informational resistance. 
By replacing Kolmogorov complexity with computable spectral and geometric metrics, we show that:
1. Quantum Mechanics is the optimal micro-compression.
2. General Relativity is the optimal macro-compression.
3. Intelligence is the self-maintenance of these compressed boundaries.

Physics is fully determined by the requirement that a bit-string representation remain smooth, coupled, and persistent.
