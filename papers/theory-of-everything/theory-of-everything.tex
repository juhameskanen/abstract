\title{The  Derivation  of Reality}
\date{2024}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  We present a formal derivation of physical reality emerging from a boundary-condition of nothing. By applying the Algorithmic Selection Principle (ASP) and
  Minimal Description Length (MDL) criteria to a static configuration ensemble, we demonstrate that the laws of physics emerge as necessary
  informational artifacts.

\section{The Eight Pillars}

\subsection*{Pillar 1: The Pre-Reality}
The boundary condition $\mathbf{P}$ is the totality of all possibilities. It is the absolute no-boundary state where no logic, time, or information exists, as no distinctions have been realized.

\subsection*{Pillar 2: The Observer Exists}
Since $\mathbf{P}$ excludes nothing, it must contain finite informational subsets. The existence of a structured world requires no external cause; it is a necessary subset of the infinite potential.

\subsection*{Pillar 3: The Static Multiverse}
We represent the structure of a world as a configuration space $\mathcal{C} \cong \{0, 1\}^n$. Each bitstring $\mathbf{s}$ is a static state. There is no motion, only the coexistence of all potential states.

\subsection*{Pillar 4: The Emergence of Time}
Time is not a fundamental dimension but a permutation of configurations. An observer's "history" is a specific path $\gamma$ through $\mathcal{C}$.

\subsection*{Pillar 5: The Observer Filter}
Only permutations capable of supporting stable, self-referential informational structures (observers) are realized as "experienced" reality.

\subsection*{Pillar 6: The Algorithmic Selection Principle (ASP)}
Path selection is governed by Kolmogorov complexity $K(H)$. Sequences with high compressibility (low $K$) are preferred. This suppresses "chaotic" or "infinite" paths, leading to an emergent finite physics:
\[ H_{\text{MDL}} = \arg\min_H K(H) \]

\subsection*{Pillar 7: The Wavefunction as Optimal Encoding}
The wavefunction $\Psi$ is the most efficient compression of the path ensemble. Interference and superposition are artifacts of this maximally efficient encoding. The Born Rule emerges naturally:
\[ P(\gamma) \propto 2^{-K(\gamma)} \sim |\Psi(\gamma)|^2 \]

\subsection*{Pillar 8: Emergent Gravitation}
Microstructures emerge according to a log-normal distribution relative to bit-flip mutations. In 3D space, this density gradient is interpreted as spacetime curvature. An observer "falls" toward higher density (lower MDL cost). Geodesics are simply the most compressible paths through the configuration ensemble.
