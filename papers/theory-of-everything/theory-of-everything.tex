\begin{abstract}
We present an informational ontology in which physical laws emerge from observer-conditioned typicality.
Quantum mechanics and general relativity arise as a trinity of complementary, orthogonal representations of the same underlying informational substrate.
These three representations are mutually orthogonal: none is sufficient alone, and the observer’s realized history is determined by the joint optimization of their informational complexity.
We formalize this via the D--$\psi$--G decomposition and demonstrate that emergent physics is fully determined by observer survival, collapsing all apparent free parameters to zero.

\section{Introduction}

Reality can be formalized as a collection of abstract information without intrinsic geometry, ordering, or dynamics.
Observers are structured informational entities, and their existence selects for configurations exhibiting regularity and stability.
We develop a framework in which quantum mechanics and general relativity emerge as complementary compression channels acting on the same informational substrate.
An observer-conditioned probability measure, together with the D--$\psi$--G decomposition, ensures that all physical laws arise naturally from joint complexity minimization, without introducing extraneous parameters.

\section{Ontological Premises}

\subsection{Fundamental Information Space}

We adopt a finite binary representation for clarity: let $\mathcal{C} = \{0,1\}^n$ denote all $n$-bit configurations. Each $s \in \mathcal{C}$ is a static, timeless configuration. At this level:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Configurations are unordered and all exist equally.
    \item No external time or dynamics is assumed.
\end{itemize}

A permutation $\sigma: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$ defines an ordering of these configurations, representing a ``movie'' of possible states. Most permutations are incoherent; observers interact only with structured \emph{paths} $\gamma = (s_1, \dots, s_T)$ preserving informational continuity.

\subsection{Observers and Induced Time}

Observers are coherent subpatterns along paths through $\mathcal{C}$, requiring:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Memory and continuity,
    \item The ability to model internal states and predict outcomes,
    \item Well-defined boundaries to preserve identity.
\end{itemize}

Time is emergent along observer paths; macroscopic causality and dynamics are models of this ordering.

\section{Compression and Spectral Complexity}

\subsection{Spectral Complexity and the Wavefunction}

Define the \emph{spectral complexity} of a path $\gamma$ as $\mathcal{C}_\psi[\gamma]$, the minimal representation in terms of frequencies, phases, and amplitudes needed to capture observer-relevant information.

- Low $\mathcal{C}_\psi$ → smooth, compressible, highly probable worlds.  
- High $\mathcal{C}_\psi$ → chaotic, uncompressible, low-probability worlds.

The wavefunction encodes an ensemble of observer-compatible paths. Interference reflects shared substructure, and probabilities correspond to relative description weights. Linearity and complex amplitudes emerge from optimal spectral encoding, explaining why observers perceive a deterministic, continuous $\psi$.

\subsection{Geometric Complexity and Emergent GR}

Intelligent observers require boundaries to maintain identity. Geometric space is optimal for representing these boundaries. Minimal geometric complexity, $\mathcal{C}_G[\gamma]$, penalizes both spatial roughness and temporal variation of curvature:

\[
L_G \sim \int d^4x \left( \lvert \nabla K \rvert^2 + \lvert \partial_t K \rvert^2 \right),
\]

where $K$ is a curvature-like field. Low $\mathcal{C}_G$ histories dominate, producing Einstein-like dynamics as the unique stable compression attractor.

\subsection{Discrete Complexity}

The discrete instantiation $\mathcal{C}_D[\gamma]$ corresponds to particle-like states, the ``pixels'' of reality, ensuring observer consistency with minimal information dissipation.

\section{Unified Probability}

\subsection{Joint Complexity}

We decompose observer-path complexity additively:

\[
\mathcal{C}_O[\gamma] = \alpha_D \mathcal{C}_D[\gamma] + \alpha_\psi \mathcal{C}_\psi[\gamma] + \alpha_G \mathcal{C}_G[\gamma].
\]

\subsection{Observer-Conditioned Measure}

The probability of a history $\gamma \in \Gamma_O$ (all paths sustaining observer $O$) is:

\[
\mathbb{P}(\gamma \mid O) = \frac{1}{Z_O} \exp\big[-\lambda \mathcal{C}_O[\gamma]\big].
\]

$\lambda$ is the \emph{stiffness constant} weighting low-complexity paths.  
Crucially, $\lambda$ is \textbf{emergent}: it is the value that maximizes the probability of the observer existing.  
Once this condition is applied, all free parameters vanish.

\section{Emergent Physics}

Histories minimizing joint complexity dominate.  

QM dominates where $\mathcal{C}_\psi$ is significant; classical geometry dominates where $\mathcal{C}_G$ is significant.  

Maximal compression → maximal probability → maximal predictability.

\section{Zero-Parameter Universe}

Given $n$ bits of the observer wavefunction, there are $2^n$ arrangements and $(2^n)!$ orderings.  
Only a tiny fraction of these permit persistent observers.  
$\lambda$ is selected by maximizing observer probability, collapsing the framework to zero free parameters.  

\section{Interpretation}

$\psi$ and $G$ projections are mutually orthogonal.  

Observers find themselves in minimal joint-complexity histories.  

Deviations (injected intelligence) are probabilistically suppressed but may be necessary for survival.

\section{Simulations}

Demonstrations of emergent behavior are implemented in the reference simulation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{simulations/iame.py}
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

The D--$\psi$--G framework shows that:

Observer-compatible laws emerge naturally from compression-weighted probability.  

Quantum mechanics is the minimal spectral representation of paths.  

Classical geometry is the minimal geometric projection necessary for observer survival.  

There are no fundamental free parameters; $\lambda$ is fixed by observer-conditioned maximal probability.

This provides a zero-parameter, observer-centric theory of everything, unifying QM and GR as complementary projections of the same underlying information.
