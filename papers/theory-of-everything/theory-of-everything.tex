\textbf{Commuting conditions}

\[
\Pi_G \circ \psi^{-1} \circ \Pi_D \circ \psi^{-1} = \mathrm{id}_{G(\mathcal{I}_n)}, 
\quad
\Pi_D \circ \psi^{-1} \circ \Pi_G \circ \psi^{-1} = \mathrm{id}_{D(\mathcal{I}_n)}
\]


Each vertex of the triangle represents a mutually equivalent projection of the same underlying informational configuration space $\mathcal{I}_n$: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $D(\mathcal{I}_n)$: discrete representation,
    \item $\psi(\mathcal{I}_n)$: analytic representation,
    \item $G(\mathcal{I}_n)$: geometric representation.
\end{itemize}
Connecting lines are structure-preserving maps connecting the representations. 
The curved arrows illustrate invertible, commuting transformations between representations. 
The diagram formalizes that no representation is fundamental; all are mutually consistent projections of the same informational object.

\section{Three Descriptive Paradigms of Information}

We identify three and only three irreducible descriptive paradigms of information:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Discrete (set-theoretic),
    \item Analytical (spectral, wavefunction compressed),
    \item Geometric.
\end{enumerate}

These paradigms are mutually equivalent, descriptively irreducible, and jointly sufficient to express all internally meaningful informational structure.
Physical theories may privilege one paradigm for convenience, but no paradigm is fundamental.
The consistency between them replaces the role traditionally assigned to physical laws.

This triadic structure provides a natural foundation for unifying quantum theory, spacetime geometry, and observer emergence within a single informational framework.

Translations between these paradigms preserve informational content but not descriptive primitives.
This establishes their equivalence without ontological hierarchy.

Observers emerge as configurations that are simultaneously well-defined across all three paradigms.


\section{Paradigms and Descriptions }


\subsection{Analytic Representation ($\psi$)}

\textbf{Observer Emergence Principle (Spectral Form):} 
Among the ensemble of all possible wavefunctions \(\Psi\) over configuration space \(\mathcal{C}\), 
the observer-compatible paths \(\gamma \in \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{obs}}\) are overwhelmingly likely to occur in 
the \emph{minimal-length} wavefunctions, due to algorithmic (Salomonoff) weighting:
\[
\Psi(\gamma) \propto 2^{-\mathcal{L}(\gamma)/2},
\]
where \(\mathcal{L}(\gamma)\) is the minimal spectral encoding length of \(\gamma\). 
High-entropy, incompressible wavefunctions exist but carry exponentially negligible measure; 
thus, the observer emerges almost certainly in the simplest, smoothest, low-entropy wavefunctions.


\[
\begin{array}{c}
\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{obs}} =
\{ \gamma \in \mathcal{S} \mid \mathrm{Observer}(\gamma)=1 \} \\
\text{\small (Same observer paths from D; basis for compression)} \\

\text{\small (Wavefunction as compression: smooth, predictable, low-entropy paths favored)} \\

\end{array}
\]

\section{Configurations, Paths, and the Origin of Time}

We begin from a minimal and representation-independent premise: reality is constituted by abstract information alone.
There is no privileged encoding, alphabet, ordering, geometry, probability measure, or temporal structure at the fundamental level.
Any concrete representation is a matter of convenience rather than ontology.

\subsection{Timeless Configuration Space}

For definiteness, we fix a binary representation.
With $n$ bits of information, the configuration space is
\[
\mathcal{C} = \{0,1\}^n,
\]
with cardinality $|\mathcal{C}| = 2^n$.
Each element $s \in \mathcal{C}$ is a complete, static configuration.

These configurations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item are unordered,
    \item all exist equally,
    \item are ontologically symmetric.
\end{itemize}

Most configurations resemble unstructured noise; only a vanishing fraction encode observers or observer-like structures.
This timeless configuration space closely parallels both Everett-style interpretations (no collapse, no branching) and the Wheeler--DeWitt superspace of quantum gravity.

\subsection{Permutations and Movies}

One may conceptually arrange the configurations into complete orderings.
A permutation is a bijection
\[
\sigma : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C},
\]
equivalently, a total ordering of all $2^n$ configurations.
The number of such permutations is $(2^n)!$.

Each permutation may be viewed as a complete ``movie'' containing every possible configuration exactly once.
This construction is mathematically valid, but observationally excessive:
almost all permutations are maximally incoherent and devoid of stable structure.
Permutations therefore serve as a conceptual upper bound, not as the fundamental object of experience.

\subsection{Observer Paths}

What observers actually experience are not permutations but \emph{paths}.
An observer path is a finite or semi-infinite sequence
\[
\gamma = (s_1, s_2, \dots, s_T), \quad s_i \in \mathcal{C},
\]
with no requirement to visit all configurations, and with possible repetition.

Observer paths:
\begin{itemize}
    \item traverse only a tiny subset of $\mathcal{C}$,
    \item preserve informational continuity,
    \item support memory, self-modeling, and prediction.
\end{itemize}

Every observer path is a subsequence of many permutations, but permutations are not fundamental.
The correct containment relation is:
\[
\text{Observer paths}
\;\subset\;
\text{finite sequences over } \mathcal{C}
\;\subset\;
\text{permutations of } \mathcal{C}.
\]


\subsection{Time as Induced Ordering}

The configuration space $\mathcal{C}$ is timeless.
Time is not fundamental; it is induced as the ordering along an observer path.

Observers traverse short, coherent subpaths through $\mathcal{C}$.
From regularities along these paths, they infer a past and extrapolate a future.
Cosmology, dynamics, and causality are therefore models of the path structure, not of the full configuration space.

This resolves the Wheeler--DeWitt timelessness without introducing external time or dynamics.


\subsection{Observer Filtering and Measure}

Among all possible paths, only a vanishing subset supports persistent observers.
These form the observer-compatible set $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{obs}}$.

Observer paths with high stepwise novelty---such as Boltzmann-brain-like trajectories involving random jumps across configuration space---are logically and ontologically possible.
However, they carry exponentially suppressed measure.

The distinction is not one of possibility, but of typicality.
Paths that do not compress well have negligible weight under any reasonable description-length-based measure.


\subsection{Wavefunction as Compression}

The quantum wavefunction is not a physical medium, nor a dynamical law.
It plays the role of an optimal compression of the ensemble of observer-compatible paths.

Much like a video codec compresses a family of movies by exploiting shared structure, the wavefunction encodes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item large ensembles of compatible paths,
    \item interference as shared substructure in the compressed description,
    \item probabilities as relative description weight.
\end{itemize}

There is no external player, no execution substrate, and no need for temporal unfolding.
The existence of the information itself is sufficient for lived experience.


\subsection{Why Smooth Compressed Worlds Dominate}

Although chaotic and non-compressed observer paths exist, smooth, compressed, predictable paths dominate measure.
Given any fixed amount of information, that information can be arranged to form smooth observer movies in compressed format in vastly more ways than it can be arranged to form highly irregular ones without compression.

A random draw from the ensemble of observer paths is therefore overwhelmingly likely to yield a lawful, continuous world with compression artifacts (QM).
Our experience of smooth physics is not imposed by law, but emerges from combinatorial dominance under compression-weighted selection.


\subsection{General Relativity}

Emerges as geometric projection of information.  Information of the observer, from survivals point of view
must not leak out. We must have well defined boundary of information, and that's why we have a sense of
3D body.

Universe is constant self selection filter and GR and QM are the filters. Thanks to QM we are the most probable (compressible, minimal) descriptions of consciousness,
and thanks to GR our information doesn't leak out.
