\section{The Eight Pillars}

\subsection*{Pillar 1: The Pre-Reality}
The boundary condition $\mathbf{P}$ is the totality of all possibilities. It is the absolute no-boundary state where no logic, time, or information exists, as no distinctions have been realized.

\subsection*{Pillar 2: The Observer Exists}
Since $\mathbf{P}$ excludes nothing, it must contain finite informational subsets. The existence of a structured world requires no external cause; it is a necessary subset of the infinite potential.

\subsection*{Pillar 3: The Static Multiverse}
We represent the structure of a world as a configuration space $\mathcal{C} \cong \{0, 1\}^n$. Each bitstring $\mathbf{s}$ is a static state. There is no motion, only the coexistence of all potential states.

\subsection*{Pillar 4: The Emergence of Time}
Time is not a fundamental dimension but a permutation of configurations. An observer's "history" is a specific path $\gamma$ through $\mathcal{C}$.

\subsection*{The Observer Filter: $\mathcal{T}_{obs}$}
The vast majority of configurations in $\mathcal{C}$ represent algorithmic "white noise" with no capacity for informational recursion. We define the subset of paths $\mathcal{T}_{obs}$ as those containing stable, self-referential structures. Only paths in $\mathcal{T}_{obs}$ possess a subjective "inside," where the algorithmic processing of states is realized as experience. This filter explains the apparent "fine-tuning" of the universe: we do not find ourselves in a chaotic world because chaos, by definition, lacks the structure to support an observer.

\subsection*{Pillar 5: The Observer Filter}
Only permutations capable of supporting stable, self-referential informational structures (observers) are realized as "experienced" reality.

\subsection*{Pillar 6: The Algorithmic Selection Principle (ASP)}
Path selection is governed by Kolmogorov complexity $K(H)$. Sequences with high compressibility (low $K$) are preferred. This suppresses "chaotic" or "infinite" paths, leading to an emergent finite, predictable physics:
\[ H_{\text{MDL}} = \arg\min_H K(H) \]

\subsection*{Pillar 7: The Wavefunction as Optimal Encoding}
The wavefunction $\Psi$ is the most efficient compression of the path ensemble. Interference and superposition are artifacts of this maximally efficient encoding. The Born Rule is emergent:
\[ P(\gamma) \propto 2^{-K(\gamma)} \sim |\Psi(\gamma)|^2 \]


\subsection*{Pillar 8 --- Emergent Gravitation: The Log-Normal Pressure}

Physical gravitation is the macroscopic manifestation of the statistical density gradient of microstructure motifs within the configuration ensemble.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Microstructure Distribution:} The emergence of microstructures follows a log-normal distribution $L(d)$ as a function of bit-flip mutations (minimal Shannon entropy increase):
    \[ L(d) = \frac{1}{d\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(\ln d - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \]
    
    \item \textbf{3D Geometric Projection:} In three-dimensional space, the density $\rho$ of these motifs undergoes geometric dilution, yielding the probability pressure:
    \[ \rho(r) \propto \frac{L(r)}{r^2} \]
    
  \item \textbf{The Geodesic as MDL:} An observer "falls" toward configurations that maximize the availability of required microstructures.
    This minimizes the innovation cost of the observer's continued existence. The resulting trajectory $\gamma$ satisfies the Minimal Description Length (MDL) criterion:
    \[ \delta \int_{\gamma} K(\text{state}) \, ds = 0 \]
\end{enumerate}

Spacetime curvature is thus a geometric interpretation of the selection pressure exerted by the Algorithmic Selection Principle.
The "Singularity" at $d \to 0$ represents an algorithmic limit where the density of realizable microstructures drops to zero, rendering the center unreachable.
