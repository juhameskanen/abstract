\section{The Eight Pillars}

\subsection*{Pillar 1: The Pre-Reality}
Reality begins as abstract information itself, with no privileged representation, alphabet, ordering, geometry, or probability measure.
Any concrete encoding (binary, ternary, continuous, or otherwise) is a matter of convenience rather than ontology.
Entropy, time, and physical law arise only relative to observer-defined representations and coarse-grainings.

\subsection*{Pillar 2: The Observer Exists}
Since $\mathbf{P}$ excludes nothing, it must contain finite informational subsets.
The existence of a structured world requires no external cause; it is a necessary subset of the infinite potential.

\subsection*{Pillar 3: The Static Multiverse}
We represent the structure of a world as a configuration space $\mathcal{C} \cong \{0, 1\}^n$. Each bitstring $\mathbf{s}$ is a static state.
There is no motion, only the coexistence of all potential states.
Binary set is not fundamental, it is chosen only as convenient basis.

\subsection*{Pillar 4: The Emergence of Time}
Time is not a fundamental dimension but a permutation of configurations.

\subsection*{Pillar 5: The Observer Filter: $\mathcal{T}_{obs}$}
Only paths in $\mathcal{T}_{\text{obs}}$ possess a subjective "inside," where the algorithmic processing of states is realized as experience.
An observer's "history" is a specific path $\gamma$ through $\mathcal{C}$.

\subsection*{Pillar 6: The Spectral Selection Principle (SSP)}
Path selection is governed by their compressibility in a spectral basis.
Paths with efficient spectral representations dominate the measure, leading to an emergent finite, predictable physics:
\[ H_{\text{MDL}} = \arg\min_H \mathcal{L}(H) \]

\subsection*{Pillar 7: The Wavefunction as Optimal Encoding}
The wavefunction $\Psi$ is the most efficient spectral compression of the path ensemble.
Interference and superposition are artifacts of this maximally efficient encoding.
The Born Rule is emergent:
\[ P(\gamma) \propto 2^{-\mathcal{L}(\gamma)} \sim |\Psi(\gamma)|^2 \]

\subsection*{Pillar 8 --- Emergent Gravitation: The Log-Normal Pressure}

Physical gravitation is the macroscopic manifestation of the statistical density gradient of microstructure motifs within the configuration ensemble.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Microstructure Distribution:} The emergence of microstructures is approximated by a log-normal distribution $L(d)$ as a function of bit-flip mutations (minimal Shannon entropy increase):
    \[ L(d) = \frac{1}{d\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(\ln d - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \]
    
    \item \textbf{3D Geometric Projection:} In three-dimensional space, the density $\rho$ of these motifs undergoes geometric dilution, yielding the probability pressure:
    \[ \rho(r) \propto \frac{L(r)}{r^2} \]
    
    \item \textbf{The Geodesic as MDL:} An observer "falls" toward configurations that maximize the availability of required microstructures.
    This minimizes the innovation cost of the observer's continued existence.
    The resulting trajectory $\gamma$ satisfies the Minimal Spectral Description criterion:
    \[ \delta \int_{\gamma} \mathcal{L}(\text{state}) \, ds = 0 \]
\end{enumerate}

Spacetime curvature is thus a geometric interpretation of the selection pressure exerted by the Spectral Selection Principle.
The "Singularity" at $d \to 0$ represents a limit where the density of realizable microstructures drops to zero, rendering the center unreachable.
