\title{Black Hole Singularities as Zero Entropy States}

\date{2010}

\begin{abstract}
Building on the ontological equivalence of physical and informational configurations established in Paper I, we investigate black hole singularities from an information-theoretic perspective, viewing geometric spacetime and computational simulation as two equivalent interpretations of an underlying informational structure.

Standard General Relativity (GR) simulations cannot be executed to the point of singularity formation due to the fundamental breakdown of GR and the resulting numerical divergences. However, by analyzing the simulation’s execution trace of infalling dust particles, we observe a monotonic drop in Shannon entropy as they approach the center. Even where the geometric description fails, the informational trend remains clear. Extrapolating this entropy decay leads to an inevitable conclusion: the geometric singularity is a state of zero information. Thus, the breakdown of spacetime is not a mathematical error, but the physical manifestation of information exhaustion. We demonstrate that singularities can be successfully studied through an information-theoretic lens where traditional geometry fails.

\section{Introduction}

We apply a computational and information-theoretic framework to black hole singularities. 
The guiding hypothesis is that spacetime geometry and the execution of a simulation 
can be viewed as complementary descriptions of the same underlying informational structure.

Our central question is whether approaching singularities as information-theoretic phenomena 
provides new insights into their structure and physical interpretation. To explore this, 
we develop both analytic reasoning and numerical simulations of collapsing dust clouds.

\section{Methods}

We model black hole evolution through computational simulation. 
We compute the \emph{execution-trace entropy} of the discretized particle positions, 
which captures the number of distinguishable geometric configurations encoded in memory.

\subsection{Execution Trace}

Let \(\mathcal{M}\) denote the set of all memory locations in a deterministic computing system. 
A \emph{machine state} \(\mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{M}\) is a complete assignment of values 
to all memory elements. Let \(\mathcal{P} = (I_1, I_2, \dots, I_n)\) be a finite sequence of deterministic instructions, 
with \(I_k : \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}\). The \emph{execution trace} \(\mathcal{T}\) of program \(\mathcal{P}\) 
is the ordered sequence of states
\[
\mathcal{T} = (s_0, s_1, \dots, s_n), \quad s_{k+1} = I_{k+1}(s_k).
\]

The execution trace encodes all information about the simulated phenomenon. 
In practice, we focus on the \emph{bitstring sub-trace} that encodes spatial geometry.

\subsection{Mapping Geometry to Bitstrings}

Let a geometric state be encoded as a bitstring \(b \in \{0,1\}^L\), representing the discretized positions 
of all particles in the dust cloud. Let
\[
C = \{0,1\}^{3k}
\]
be the space of 3D configurations. Define
\[
f : C \to \mathbb{Z}^3, \quad f(b) = (\phi(b_1), \phi(b_2), \phi(b_3)),
\]
where \(\phi : \{0,1\}^k \to \mathbb{Z}\) decodes fixed-length binary segments. 
Quantization ensures that the encoding reflects true positional differences, 
minimizing spurious entropy from floating-point representations.

\subsection{Execution-Trace Entropy}

To quantify distinguishable configurations, we compute the Shannon entropy of the bitstring representation:

\[
H(b) = -p_0 \log_2 p_0 - p_1 \log_2 p_1,
\]

where \(p_0\) and \(p_1\) are the empirical frequencies of 0- and 1-bits in \(b\). 

Over a sequence of states (the bitstring sub-trace), the entropy trajectory reflects the collapse of distinguishable geometric states as particles fall toward the singularity.

\section{Simulations}

We simulated both Schwarzschild (non-rotating) and Kerr (rotating) black holes. 
All simulations show a monotonic decrease in execution-trace entropy as particles fall inward. 
Extrapolation indicates that the singularity corresponds to zero entropy state.

\subsection{Lemma: Vanishing Execution-Trace Entropy Implies Geometric Singularity}

Let \(\mathcal{B}_t \subset \{0,1\}^L\) denote the set of bitstrings encoding geometry over a finite time window near \(t\). 
If
\[
H(\mathcal{B}_t) \to 0,
\]
then the set of distinguishable geometric configurations collapses to a single equivalence class under \(f\). That is, the geometry degenerates to a unique configuration.

\section{Discussion}

Our simulations confirm the Entropy–Singularity Lemma in a computational context. 
Although global black hole thermodynamic entropy increases, the local execution-trace entropy encoding spatial geometry decreases toward the singularity. 
This reflects the narrowing of accessible informational states and growing determinism in geometry.

\subsection{Bitstring Encoding Procedure}

To encode geometry:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Quantize continuous coordinates: \(\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{Z}\)
    \item Convert integers to fixed-width binary strings
    \item Concatenate binary segments into a full state bitstring
\end{enumerate}

Entropy is then computed as above. The collapse of this entropy directly reflects the loss of distinguishable structure.

\section{Conclusion}

Singularities might not be pathological or broken regions of spacetime. Instead, they are perfectly well-defined, smooth geometric
objects—points—precisely because the system has exhausted the informational capacity required to support any complex structure, volume, or
fluctuation. By viewing the breakdown of spacetime through an information-theoretic lens, we replace physical divergence with
informational convergence, offering a bridge between computational reality and gravitational collapse.
