\title{Quantum Geodesics in Informational Space: Recovering Classical Paths from Phase-Coherent Spectral Entropy}

\date{2022}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present a constructive proof-of-concept demonstrating that classical geodesic paths on a curved surface can be recovered by minimizing an informational cost functional defined over discrete execution traces. 
Specifically, we compare Euclidean action minimization with minimization of a \emph{phase-coherent spectral entropy} computed from local bit-encoded wavefunction segments. 
Without assuming any prior equivalence between geometric and informational principles, we show that both methods select nearly identical paths across a range of noisy, nontrivial geometries. 
This result supports the hypothesis that classical spacetime dynamics may emerge from an underlying informational principle.

\section{Introduction}
The principle of least action occupies a foundational role in classical and quantum physics. 
In Euclidean quantum gravity, the action functional governs the weighting of paths in a path integral formulation, while in classical general relativity geodesics extremize proper distance or action. 
Information-theoretic approaches have long suggested that entropy, complexity, or information content may play a fundamental role in physical law. 
However, most prior work draws conceptual analogies rather than providing explicit constructive equivalence.

In this work, we investigate whether a purely informational cost functional, defined independently of geometry, can recover classical geodesic behavior. 
Our approach is algorithmic and discrete: paths are selected step-by-step by minimizing either Euclidean action or \emph{phase-coherent spectral entropy} over local execution traces. 
Remarkably, we find strong agreement between the two resulting paths.

\section{Geometric Setup}
We consider a two-dimensional spatial domain embedded in a three-dimensional height field, representing a curved metric surface. 
The surface is constructed as a superposition of Gaussian hills and valleys with added stochastic noise. 
Let $\phi(x,y)$ denote the surface height. 
The classical Euclidean action for a path $\gamma$ proceeding in the $x$ direction is approximated locally by
\begin{equation}
I_E \approx \sum_x \left( \nabla_x \phi \right)^2,
\end{equation}
where the gradient is discretized on a grid. 
At each step, the next path position is chosen from a local neighborhood to minimize the incremental contribution to $I_E$.

\section{Informational Cost Functional with Phase Coherence}
Independently of geometry, we define an informational cost functional based on local spectral properties of bit-encoded surface segments. 
For each candidate path segment, the local surface values are thresholded relative to a local mean to produce a binary sequence, interpreted as a discrete ``wavefunction.'' 
A real Fourier transform is applied to compute the power spectral density (PSD) of the segment.

The spectral entropy is computed as
\begin{equation}
H = -\sum_k p_k \log_2 p_k,
\end{equation}
where $p_k$ is the normalized power in frequency mode $k$. 
Lower entropy corresponds to smoother, more compressible waveforms.

Crucially, we introduce a \emph{phase coherence} term to capture smoothness along the path. 
Specifically, we compute the variance of the Fourier phase angles between consecutive bit-blocks along the segment. 
The total informational cost is then
\begin{equation}
C = H + \lambda \, \mathrm{Var}(\theta),
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ denotes the spectral phase angles and $\lambda$ is a tunable weight. 
Minimizing this cost favors paths that are not only low-entropy but also \emph{phase-stable}, effectively producing a ``quantum geodesic'' in informational space.

\section{Path-Finding Algorithm}
Both the Euclidean and informational methods employ the same local path-finding structure. 
Starting from a fixed boundary condition, the path advances column by column. 
At each step, three candidate positions are evaluated, and the one minimizing the respective cost functional is selected. 

Importantly, no geometric information is used in the informational method beyond the raw surface samples; likewise, no informational quantities appear in the Euclidean action.

\section{Results}
Across multiple randomly generated surfaces and noise realizations, the paths selected by Euclidean action minimization and phase-coherent spectral entropy minimization are nearly identical. 
Minor deviations occur primarily near regions of high curvature or noise, but the global path structure remains consistent. 

Heatmap visualizations of the accumulated action and informational cost reveal correlated cost landscapes, with minima aligned along similar valleys of the surface. 
Incorporating phase coherence significantly improves alignment of the QBitwave path with the Euclidean geodesic, especially in regions with ambiguous local gradients.

\subsection*{Systematic Noise Study}
To further explore the relationship between geometric action and informational cost, we conducted a parameter sweep using the program \texttt{entropy\_action\_comparison.py}. 
Here, paths were generated as simple sinusoidal metrics with varying levels of Gaussian noise. 
For each noise level, we computed the Euclidean action (sum of squared gradients) and the spectral entropy of bit-encoded segments, along with a compressibility measure representing informational ``weight'' of the path. 
At low noise, both measures correlate strongly, reproducing the PoC results. 
As noise increases, the Euclidean action rises monotonically, reflecting growing geometric irregularity, while the spectral entropy exhibits a saturation effect due to phase coherence and finite-resolution encoding. 
This divergence illustrates that informational metrics can impose natural cutoffs or stability constraints not captured by purely geometric action, providing additional insight into how information-theoretic principles might regulate path selection in complex environments.

\section{Discussion}
The observed correspondence suggests that classical geodesics may be understood as paths of minimum informational cost, where information is quantified in terms of spectral complexity and phase stability of local execution traces. 
Unlike prior entropic or informational interpretations of gravity, this result is constructive and algorithmic. 

While this work does not constitute a theory of quantum gravity or a unification framework, it provides concrete evidence that geometric action and phase-coherent informational measures can coincide in nontrivial settings. 
This supports the broader hypothesis that spacetime dynamics may emerge from informational principles.

\section{Limitations and Future Work}
The present study is limited to two-dimensional surfaces and heuristic discretizations. 
Future work should extend the method to full two-dimensional geodesics, higher-dimensional manifolds, and continuous limits. 
Formal analytical relationships between Euclidean action, spectral entropy, and phase variance remain open questions.

\section{Conclusion}
We have demonstrated that minimizing phase-coherent spectral entropy over discrete execution traces can recover classical geodesic paths on curved surfaces. 
This result strengthens the case for information-theoretic foundations of physical law and motivates further investigation into informational formulations of action principles.
