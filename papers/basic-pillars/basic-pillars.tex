\section{Pillar 1 --- The Pre-Reality: Infinite Potential}
A theory of everything cannot assume anything. If any law, structure, logic, information, or distinction is predefined, the theory is incomplete by construction. Therefore, we assume reality begins not with laws, but with unlimited potential.

\textbf{Axiom 1 (Pre-Reality).} There exists an unconstrained domain $\mathbf{P}$, called \textit{Pre-Reality}, defined as the totality of all possible configurations:
\[
\mathbf{P} = \{\text{all possibilities}\}
\]
No structure, measure, ordering, logic, time, or information is defined on $\mathbf{P}$. Information does not exist at this level because information requires realized distinctions (entropy), and no distinctions are assumed.

Pillar 1 is not an empirical hypothesis but a boundary condition. Its role is to deny the existence of prior constraints on reality.

\section{Pillar 2 --- The Observer Exists}
A Theory of Everything without the observer is, by definition, incomplete. An \textbf{observer} is a finite, informational structure. 

\textbf{Corollary 2.1 (Existence of Structured Worlds).} Since no configuration is excluded from $\mathbf{P}$, there exists at least one finite subset:
\[
\exists\, S \subset \mathbf{P}
\]
within which internal relations define distinctions, information, mathematics, physical laws, and conscious observers. Existence requires no external explanation---nothing forbids it.

\section{Pillar 3: Configuration Space --- The Static Multiverse}
We formalize the existence of a finite informational structure with the simplest representation: the \textbf{bitstring}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item A bitstring of length $n$ allows us to construct a \textbf{configuration space}: all $2^n$ possible bitstrings. Each bitstring represents a potential \textbf{state of the universe}---an Everettian world.
    \item The total space is the \textbf{Superspace} of the Wheeler--DeWitt equation ($\Psi$).
    \item All these worlds coexist in the static library of possibilities.
\end{itemize}

\section{Pillar 4 --- Permutation Space: The Emergence of Time}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{permutation} of the configurations defines a \textbf{path} or ``history'' through the static multiverse.
    \item \textbf{Time} emerges as the observer’s sequential experience along such a path. It is \textbf{not fundamental}, but a relational, emergent property of moving through ordered informational states.
    \item \textbf{The Arrow of Time} is a consequence of this ordering; it is the direction of increasing realized information (entropy) as the observer traverses the permutation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Pillar 5 --- Selection Filter: MDL and ASP}
Among all possible paths through a finite informational subset $S \subset \mathbf{P}$, the observer's finite memory and requirement for coherence naturally filter the paths that can be experienced.

\textbf{Minimal Description Length (MDL):} Smooth, predictable sequences are algorithmically compressible. Let $H = (s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n)$ denote a path. Sequences with low Kolmogorov complexity $K(H)$ are \textbf{more likely}, while incompressible sequences are suppressed.

\textbf{Algorithmic Selection Principle (ASP):} Paths of minimal description length are dominated:
\[
H_\text{MDL} = \arg\min_H K(H)
\]
\textbf{Emergent Finiteness:} Infinite-memory paths are algorithmically incompressible and therefore have zero probability. Laws of physics are not fundamental; they are the optimal compression of information.

\section{Pillar 6 --- The Wavefunction as an Optimal Encoding}
The wavefunction ($\Psi$) is the optimal compression algorithm. The formal properties of quantum mechanics (superposition, linear evolution, interference) arise as artifacts of any maximally efficient encoding.

\subsection*{The Born Rule (Decoding Measure)}
The Born Rule emerges as a natural consequence of consistently decoding the compressed representation:
\[
P(\gamma) \propto |\psi(\gamma)|^2 \sim 2^{-K(\gamma)}
\]
where $K(\gamma)$ is the Kolmogorov complexity of the path $\gamma$. The squared amplitude measures the effective probability of each continuation.

\section{Pillar 7 --- Emergent Geometry: Gravity as Geometric Interpretation}
Gravity is the geometric interpretation of probability gradients in configuration space.

\textbf{Geodesics as MDL Paths:} Geodesics are the most compressible and hence the most probable permutations, those satisfying the Minimal Description Length (MDL) criterion. Physical curvature is the manifestation of the selection pressure exerted by the Algorithmic Selection Principle.
