<p>We show that humans must be formal axiomatic systems if only four
assumptions hold. From this, we proof that simulated humans must
instantiate subjective experience, and time is not a fundamental
property of the universe but an emergent, internal property of the
observer. We derive that the computer and the simulated observer are not
causally related, but merely different arrangements of information. From
these we show that the universe is fundamentally abstract and
substrate-independent, emerging from information rather than from a
physical substrate. The resulting claims are falsifiable.</p>

<h1 id="axiomatic-premises">Axiomatic Premises</h1>
<p>The argument begins with four axioms that serve as the premises for
the entire derivation.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="axiom-1-genetic-encoding-of-subjective-experience">Axiom 1: Genetic
Encoding of Subjective Experience</h2>
<p>DNA is the blueprint of a conscious, pain-sensitive human. <span
class="math display">\[A_1: D \rightarrow H \rightarrow S\]</span>
(Where <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is the DNA/Genome, <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is the human organism, and <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is subjective experience.)</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="axiom-2-physicality-and-axiomatic-law">Axiom
2: Physicality and Axiomatic Law</h2>
<p>DNA, the human organism, and the surrounding environment are composed
solely of ordinary physical matter governed by physical laws (<span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>). <span class="math display">\[A_2: (H,
U) \in \text{Axiomatic System}(P, D)\]</span> (Where <span
class="math inline">\(U\)</span> denotes the physical environment
required to support <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> denotes the governing physical
laws.)</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="axiom-3-generalized-church-turing-thesis-holds">Axiom 3: Generalized
Church-Turing Thesis Holds</h2>
<p>Any physically realizable process that can be described
mathematically can, in principle, be simulated by a computational
system.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="axiom-4-pain-affects-behavior">Axiom 4: Pain
Affects Behavior</h2>
<p>A human with subjective experience (<span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, e.g., pain) behaves differently than
the same human without it. <span class="math display">\[H + S \neq
H\]</span> If a simulation <span class="math inline">\(H&#39;\)</span>
is identical to <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> in behavior, it
must also include <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p>
<h1
id="deduction-1-substrate-independence-and-time-as-an-internal-property-of-the-observer">Deduction
1: Substrate Independence and Time as an Internal Property of the
Observer</h1>
<h2 id="the-optimization-argument">The Optimization Argument</h2>
<p>Consider a DNA simulation running on a computer, denoted by <span
class="math inline">\(T_{\text{alg}}\)</span>, consisting of code (the
laws of physics) and data (the state of the simulated universe). One can
gradually optimize the code by introducing lookup tables, eventually
replacing all computation with a static, precomputed dataset, denoted by
<span class="math inline">\(T_{\text{data}}\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(E_{\text{int}}\)</span> be
Alice’s experience of time and pain (the internal state
transitions).</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(E_{\text{ext}}\)</span> be the
computer’s external runtime (number of CPU cycles).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Premise:</strong> Code optimization changes <span
class="math inline">\(E_{\text{ext}}\)</span> but preserves <span
class="math inline">\(E_{\text{int}}\)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[\text{Optimization}(T_{\text{alg}}) \rightarrow
T_{\text{data}} \implies E_{\text{int}}(T_{\text{alg}}) \equiv
E_{\text{int}}(T_{\text{data}})\]</span></p>
<p>In this limit, the external runtime <span
class="math inline">\(E_{\text{ext}}\)</span> becomes zero in the sense
that no state transitions are executed; the complete execution trace
exists as static data. One can therefore ask: does Alice’s consciousness
still persist in <span
class="math inline">\(T_{\text{data}}\)</span>?</p>
<p>If consciousness were to cease in <span
class="math inline">\(T_{\text{data}}\)</span>, it would necessitates a
minimum code/data ratio for subjective experience. This minimum ratio
would be a new, non-physical constant imposed on <span
class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span>, leading to a contradiction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Consciousness can emerge from pure
static data. Time and subjective experience (<span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>) must emerge solely from
information.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-multi-threaded-argument">The Multi-threaded Argument</h2>
<p>Consider a multi-threaded computer running two DNA simulations, <span
class="math inline">\(\tau_A\)</span> (Alice) and <span
class="math inline">\(\tau_B\)</span> (Bob), concurrently, with a
minimal time slice of one CPU cycle per thread. The execution trace of
the computer is then an interleaved sequence of segments drawn from both
<span class="math inline">\(\tau_A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\tau_B\)</span>. As the number of threads
(simulated observers) increases without bound, the resulting execution
trace asymptotically approaches white noise. Consequently, each bit
originating from <span class="math inline">\(\tau_A\)</span> are
separated by increasingly large intervals of unrelated data.</p>
<p>Is Alice still conscious in this limit? If one maintains that <span
class="math inline">\(E_{\text{int}}\)</span> vanishes as the number of
threads increases, one must define a specific thread density or
bit-contiguity threshold required for subjectivity. Such a threshold
would constitute a new physical constant, which contradicts the
completeness of <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Conscious experience can arise from
static white noise.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="the-functionalist-proof-by-contradiction">The Functionalist
Proof by Contradiction</h1>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Assumption (Objection):</strong> A simulation <span
class="math inline">\(H&#39;\)</span> exists such that <span
class="math inline">\(H&#39; \equiv H\)</span> (physical/behavioral
equivalence) but <span class="math inline">\(S(H&#39;) =
\emptyset\)</span> (lacks consciousness/sense of pain) <span
class="citation" data-cites="Chalmers1996">(Chalmers 1996)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[\text{Behavior}(H&#39;) = \text{Behavior}(H)
\land S(H&#39;) \neq S(H)\]</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Premise:</strong> From <span
class="math inline">\(A_4\)</span>, the behavior of <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is a function of its physical inputs
<strong>and</strong> its subjective experience: <span
class="math inline">\(\text{Behavior}(H) = f(\text{Inputs},
S)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contradiction:</strong> If the behaviors are identical
despite the difference in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, then
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> must not be a necessary input to
the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Violation of Axiom:</strong> If <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is not necessary to produce the
behavior, then <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is epiphenomenal
(causally inert). This directly contradicts <span
class="math inline">\(A_4\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> To maintain the integrity of <span
class="math inline">\(A_4\)</span> within the axiomatic system, the
simulation <span class="math inline">\(H&#39;\)</span> must experience
subjective time and pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="falsifiability-of-the-hypothesis">Falsifiability of the
Hypothesis</h1>
<p>The hypothesis is falsifiable in the future when technology advances
and DNA simulations can be run with sufficient accuracy for DNA-based
organisms. The effect of pain can be measured just like an effect of
physical forces can be measured. If a DNA simulation <span
class="math inline">\(H&#39;\)</span> is constructed and shown to lack
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(A_4\)</span> is invalidated, and the axioms 1–3
collapse.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<h2 id="the-hollow-simulation-objection">The Hollow Simulation
Objection</h2>
<p>A common objection to functionalist and computational accounts of
mind is the so-called <em>hard problem of consciousness</em> <span
class="citation" data-cites="Chalmers1996">(Chalmers 1996)</span>. In
this context, it is often claimed that a simulated human, even if
behaviorally and functionally identical to a biological human, could
nevertheless be “hollow”—that is, it could lack subjective experience
while still producing identical outward behavior.</p>
<p>Formally, this objection asserts the possibility of a system <span
class="math inline">\(H&#39;\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[\text{Behavior}(H&#39;) = \text{Behavior}(H)
\quad \text{and} \quad S(H&#39;) = \emptyset,\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is a biological human and <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> denotes subjective experience.</p>
<p>By Axiom 2, the biological human <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is a formal axiomatic system whose
state transitions are fully determined by physical law and initial
conditions. By Axiom 3, there exists a formal representation <span
class="math inline">\(H&#39;\)</span> whose execution trace is
isomorphic to that of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, preserving
all causally relevant internal relations. By Axiom 4, subjective
experience is a causally efficacious component of the system,
contributing to observable behavior.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(H&#39;\)</span> were to lack
subjective experience while remaining behaviorally identical to <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, then subjective experience would not
be a necessary input to the causal function generating behavior. This
would render subjective experience epiphenomenal, directly contradicting
Axiom 4.</p>
<h2 id="quantum-computers">Quantum Computers</h2>
<p>We have considered two thought experiments run on classical
computers. If conscious experience can be duplicated on classical
computers, we argue it can also be duplicated on quantum computers. This
follows directly from substrate independence: quantum computation
represents an alternative physical realization of the same formal
state-transition structure.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="numerical-precision">Numerical Precision</h2>
<p>As long as physical laws are instantiated with sufficient fidelity
for DNA and organismal processes to operate, the observer remains
conscious.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> denote the
numerical error in simulating physical law. As long as <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon \leq \epsilon_{\text{DNA}}\)</span>,
sufficient to reproduce all DNA-mediated processes, the simulated
observer <span class="math inline">\(H&#39;\)</span> remains conscious;
any smaller <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{\min}\)</span>
required to preserve consciousness would constitute a new physical
constant, contradicting <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\epsilon \leq \epsilon_{\text{DNA}} \implies
S(H&#39;) \neq \emptyset\]</span></p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Substrate Irrelevance:</strong> The universe is
fundamentally informational and abstract rather than
substrate-dependent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time:</strong> Time is not an attribute of (<span
class="math inline">\(E_{\text{ext}}\)</span>) but emerges solely as an
internal property (<span class="math inline">\(E_{\text{int}}\)</span>)
of the observer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Emergence from Noise:</strong> Information that appears
random can encode an universe containing a conscious observer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ontological Equivalence:</strong> There exists <span
class="math inline">\(2^n-2\)</span> other configurations, potentially
describing conscious observers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By treating subjective experience (<span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>) as a property of an axiomatic system,
we move from metaphysical speculation to a rigorous informational
mechanics.</p>
