<p>We present a toy informational model of quantum gravity in which
physical laws are emergent consequences of a maximally compressed
informational universe. Observers are treated as compressed Gaussian
wavefunction structures, whose probability of existence is proportional
to their informational complexity. Particles are generated from a
probabilistic field influenced by all observers, and candidate
trajectories are selected according to a compressibility-based cost
function. Through this selection process, smooth, deterministic motion
naturally emerges, providing an informational explanation for inertia.
The simulation demonstrates that law-like, predictable behavior arises
from the statistical dominance of compressed observers, supporting the
broader hypothesis that both Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity
can be interpreted as emergent from optimal information compression.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The search for a unified theory of everything has been a central
pursuit in modern physics. However, traditional approaches often begin
with a set of assumed fundamental laws. This paper proposes an
alternative framework where the laws themselves are not fundamental but
are emergent from a more primitive, informational substrate.</p>
<p>The key idea is that existence itself is biased toward compression.
Observers are not passive; their probability of existing is directly
tied to how efficiently their informational structure can be described.
This leads to the following chain of reasoning:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="the-compressionexistence-principle">The
Compression–Existence Principle</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Compression increases multiplicity:</strong> An observer
that can be described with fewer bits can be described in vastly more
ways within the underlying informational substrate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multiplicity increases probability:</strong> The more
copies of an observer exist, the higher the probability that any given
observer will be one of them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Probability selects predictable worlds:</strong>
Observers therefore overwhelmingly find themselves in worlds where their
own informational structure is maximally compressible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Predictability manifests as physical law:</strong>
Smooth, regular, law-like behavior (e.g., inertia) is the kind of
information that compresses best. Consequently, the laws of physics that
we observe are not fundamental givens, but statistical artifacts of
compression dominance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In short: you observe smooth, predictable physical laws because only
in such worlds can compressed observers proliferate and dominate the
measure of existence. Quantum Mechanics, General Relativity, and others
can be pictured as the most efficient compression algorithms.</p>
<h1 id="theoretical-framework">Theoretical Framework</h1>
<h2 id="wavefunctions-as-observer-templates">Wavefunctions as Observer
Templates</h2>
<p>An observer is defined as a compressed informational structure. In
our 2D model, this structure is a parametric complex wavefunction, <span
class="math inline">\(\psi(x,t)\)</span>, representing a soft disk or
Gaussian shell:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\psi(x,t) = A \exp\big(-2\sigma^2 (r -
R)^2\big)\,\exp\big(-i(\omega t - \phi)\big)\]</span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(r = \|x - c\|\)</span> is the
radial distance from the center <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the amplitude, <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the radius of the shell, <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is its width, <span
class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is its frequency, and <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is its phase.</p>
<h2 id="observer-filtering">Observer Filtering</h2>
<p>An observer emerges from the underlying random noise field by
applying a filter. This is modeled by a Gaussian observer window, <span
class="math inline">\(O_j(x)\)</span>, which smoothly weights the
influence of particles based on their proximity to the observer’s
center:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[O_j(x) =
\exp\big(-2\sigma_{\text{obs}}^2 \|x - c_j\|^2\big)\]</span></p>
<h2 id="probabilistic-field-and-particle-generation">Probabilistic Field
and Particle Generation</h2>
<p>The random noise is represented by a large number of particles. These
particles are not governed by forces but are probabilistically resampled
from a total probability density function (PDF). This PDF is generated
from the interference pattern of all observer wavefunctions:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(x) =
\big|\Psi_{\text{total}}(x,t)\big|^2 = \left|\sum_j
\psi_j(x,t)\right|^2\]</span></p>
<p>Each step of the simulation involves resampling particles from this
emergent field, which is a direct consequence of the collective
influence of all observers.</p>
<h2 id="compression-and-emergent-inertia">Compression and Emergent
Inertia</h2>
<p>The central prediction of the theory is the generation of
deterministic motion through a selection process guided by informational
compressibility. We model this as follows:</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="soft-assignment">Soft Assignment</h3>
<p>Particles are "softly" assigned to observers using weights
proportional to both the observer’s filter function and the local
probability density:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W_j(x) \propto O_j(x)\cdot
|\psi_j(x)|^2\]</span></p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="candidate-generation">Candidate
Generation</h3>
<p>For each observer, a set of potential next positions (candidates) is
generated based on the local particle distribution. Each candidate
corresponds to a small perturbation in the observer’s wavefunction
parameters, such as phase <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> or
frequency <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. While the formal
Everettian view would require consideration of all possible arrangements
of information, this approximation via finite candidate sets is
justified by computational tractability and the concentration of
probability mass.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="compressibility-cost">Compressibility
Cost</h3>
<p>The choice among candidates is determined by an informational cost
function derived from the <strong>principle of minimal description
length (MDL)</strong>. The change in description length when moving from
state <span class="math inline">\(s_t\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(s_{t+1}\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta C_j = \mathcal{K}(s_{t+1}) -
\mathcal{K}(s_t)\]</span></p>
<p>We approximate the compressibility cost function using the Shannon
entropy of the change in velocity vector <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta v\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Cost}_j(\Delta v) = H(\Delta v)
\approx \Delta \phi^2 + \Delta f^2\]</span></p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="emergent-inertia">Emergent Inertia</h3>
<p>The observer selects the candidate trajectory with the lowest cost.
Continuity of velocity emerges because it is informationally optimal. In
this framework, inertia is not a fundamental law but a by-product of the
system’s bias toward minimal description length.</p>
<h1 id="simulation-model">Simulation Model</h1>
<p>The simulation is implemented in Python and consists of several key
classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Wavefunction:</strong> Represents the parametric Gaussian
shell.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ObserverWindow:</strong> A Gaussian function used for
soft assignment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>WavefunctionGravitySim:</strong> The main simulation
class that computes total PDF, resamples particle positions, and uses
candidate selection to implement informational inertia.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="results-and-discussion">Results and Discussion</h1>
<p>The simulation successfully demonstrates the emergence of inertial,
law-like behavior. Observers, initially placed in a random
configuration, quickly begin to move in smooth, predictable paths.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="metrics">Metrics</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Trajectory Smoothness:</strong> Observed trajectories
exhibit significantly lower variance compared to random baseline
motion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Entropy Rate of Motion:</strong> The Shannon entropy
<span class="math inline">\(H(\Delta v)\)</span> decreases over time as
trajectories stabilize.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compressibility Trend:</strong> The cumulative cost
function <span class="math inline">\(\sum_t \text{Cost}_j(\Delta
v_t)\)</span> decreases monotonically.</p></li>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This work supports the <strong>Compression–Existence
Principle</strong>: the more compressible an observer, the more ways
information can be arranged to describe them, and the higher their
probability of existence. What we call the “laws of physics” are
emergent regularities; they are selected because only such highly
compressed observers dominate the measure of existence.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="future-work">Future Work</h1>
<p>Future work will focus on extending this model to simulations in
which both Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity emerge as the most
probable compressible outcome of random selection and observer
filters.</p>
