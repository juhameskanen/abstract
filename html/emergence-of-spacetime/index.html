<p>Building on the conclusion of Paper II—that collapsing spacetime
geometry corresponds to vanishing entropy—we investigate the
time-reversed process. Whereas collapsing space corresponds to vanishing
entropy, here we hypothesize that the emergence and expansion of
spacetime are consequences of increasing entropy. Using a minimal
computational model, we evolve a zero-entropy bitstring through random
mutations, interpreting its states as geometric structures in
three-dimensional space. As the system’s entropy increases, spacetime
unfolds, and hierarchical particle-like structures emerge, reproducing
key features of matter organization and relative scale invariance. Our
results suggest that cosmic expansion can be understood as a geometric
manifestation of increasing informational entropy, with complexity and
structure arising naturally from simple, initially smooth states.</p>

Expansion</h1>
<h2 id="geometric-particle-filter">Geometric Particle filter</h2>
<p>We define an execution trace <span
class="math inline">\(S_t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t = 0
\ldots n\)</span>, where each <span class="math inline">\(S_t\)</span>
is a binary string of fixed length <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. Beginning from a state of zero Shannon
entropy (an all-zero string), we evolve <span
class="math inline">\(S_t\)</span> via random bit-flip mutations that
incrementally increase its entropy.</p>
<p>Each <span class="math inline">\(S_t\)</span> is geometrically
interpreted through various decoding schemes <span
class="math inline">\(D: \{0,1\}^L \to \mathbb{R}^d\)</span>. This
mapping results in geometric points representing the 3D Spacetime
fabric.</p>
<p>We define a hierarchy of elementary structures emerging from the
spacetime fabric as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Elementary particles:</strong> Defined as pairs of 3D points
<span class="math inline">\((p_1, p_2)\)</span> where the spatial
separation between the points is below a threshold.</p>
<p><strong>Atoms:</strong> Defined as triplets of elementary particles
<span class="math inline">\((p_1, p_2, p_3)\)</span> such that: <span
class="math display">\[0 &lt; \text{distance}(p_1, p_2) &lt;
\text{threshold}, \quad 0 &lt; \text{distance}(p_2, p_3) &lt;
\text{threshold}, \quad 0 &lt; \text{distance}(p_3, p_1) &lt;
\text{threshold}\]</span> with distances approximately equal, implying a
near-equilateral configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Molecules:</strong> Formed when two atoms are sufficiently
close. The center of an atom is the geometric mean of its points: <span
class="math display">\[\text{center(atom)} = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2 +
x_3}{3}, \frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3}{3}, \frac{z_1 + z_2 + z_3}{3}
\right)\]</span> A molecule forms if the distance between two atom
centers is below a threshold: <span
class="math display">\[\text{distance}(\text{center}(\text{atom}_1),
\text{center}(\text{atom}_2)) &lt; \text{threshold}\]</span></p>
<p>The model is minmal and arbitrary, but preserves two key features
characteristic of the real universe: (i) the hierarchical structuring of
particles, and (ii) the fact that particle sizes do not stretch with the
universe, only their mutual distances.</p>
<p>We extract and count the number of these elementary structures at
each timestep. As entropy increases through random bit flips, we observe
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At zero entropy the spacetime geometry is a point, and no
elementary particles emerge.</p></li>
<li><p>As entropy increases, the space unfolds exponentially.</p></li>
<li><p>At higher entropy, elementary particles, atoms and molecules
begin to appear, with their counts following lognormal-like
trend.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recursive-pattern-matching">Recursive pattern matching</h2>
<p>An alternative definition of emergent particles is given by recursive
bit-pattern detection. Here, the execution trace <span
class="math inline">\(S_t\)</span> itself is treated as a one
dimensional candidate space of particles, with no explicit geometric
mapping required.</p>
<p><strong>Elementary particles:</strong> Defined as short substrings
<span class="math inline">\(p \in \{0,1\}^k\)</span> that occur within
<span class="math inline">\(S_t\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Composite particles:</strong> Formed recursively by
concatenating previously defined particles. A composite particle <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is valid if it appears in <span
class="math inline">\(S_t\)</span> and if its sub-patterns are
recognized particles.</p>
<p>This recursive pattern-matching approach captures the emergence of
particles purely from informational redundancy, without reliance on an
explicit geometric embedding. The hierarchy is constructed bottom-up:
from frequent substrings (elementary particles), to composite
concatenations (atoms), to repeated higher-order motifs (molecules).</p>
<p>As with the geometric detection method, two key features of physical
reality are reproduced: (i) hierarchical structuring of matter, and (ii)
invariance of particle size with respect to global expansion.</p>
<p>By counting the number of recursive particles at each entropy level,
we again observe that zero entropy corresponds to no detectable
structures, while higher entropy states give rise to exponentially
growing numbers of particles whose abundances follow lognormal-like
distributions.</p>

<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>A central question in cosmology is why the universe began in such an
exceptionally ordered state. Traditional approaches assume that the
initial state is not perfectly smooth, constrained only by quantum
uncertainty. However, in the informational framework presented here, the
apparent necessity of an initially “rough” state is removed.</p>
<p>Beginning from a perfectly smooth, zero-entropy configuration, the
universe develops complexity through the unfolding of bitstring
information under selection filters. This mechanism naturally produces
particle-like microstructures, whose statistical properties follow
lognormal distributions. A central implication of this is that the
singularity at zero entropy is neither undefined nor pathological.</p>
<p>In this sense, the vanishing-entropy limit implies a form of
geometric smoothness that is independent of any particular coordinate
system, representation or dynamical description. With no information
available to define distinguishable microstructures, the singular state
cannot encode physical irregularities, even if classical general
relativity breaks down.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>The expansion of the universe and the increase of entropy might be
two sides of the same coin—two distinct arrangements of the same
information. The universe expands because its entropy increases.
Expanding universe is geometric interpretation of information of
increasing entropy.</p>
