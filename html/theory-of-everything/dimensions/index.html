<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>We treat geometry as the means of enforcing a well defined
inside–outside separation and preventing uncontrolled information mixing
with the environment. Given that geometry is required, we apply a
minimum description length (MDL) principle to evaluate which geometric
realizations are most probable. The central claim is that three spatial
dimensions are not necessary, but are optimal for realizing bounded,
persistent observers with well-defined interior and exterior
regions.</p>
<p>The central claim is that three spatial dimensions are not necessary,
but are <em>optimal</em> for encoding bounded, persistent observers with
well-defined interior/exterior separation.</p>
<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> denote an execution trace
representing a bounded, persistent observer. By an observer we mean an
information-processing system satisfying:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Persistence over time,</p></li>
<li><p>A well-defined interior state,</p></li>
<li><p>A boundary separating internal from external
information,</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple concurrent internal processes (e.g. signaling, energy
intake, waste removal).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(G_d\)</span> denote a geometric
encoding of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> spatial dimensions, and let <span
class="math inline">\(L(G_d)\)</span> denote the minimal description
length required to encode:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The observer interior,</p></li>
<li><p>The observer boundary <span class="math inline">\(\partial
\Omega_d\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p>The routing of internal processes within the geometry.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We consider the MDL-induced measure: <span
class="math display">\[\mu(G_d) \propto e^{-L(G_d)}.\]</span></p>
<p>The question is which spatial dimension <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> minimizes <span
class="math inline">\(L(G_d)\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="main-claim">Main Claim</h1>
<p><strong>Claim.</strong> For execution traces corresponding to
bounded, persistent observers, <span class="math display">\[L(G_3) =
\min_d L(G_d),\]</span> and therefore three-dimensional geometric
encodings dominate the MDL-induced measure.</p>
<p>Lower-dimensional encodings exist but incur prohibitively large
description length, while higher-dimensional encodings introduce
superfluous geometric degrees of freedom without compensating reduction
in encoding cost.</p>
<h1 id="sketch-of-argument">Sketch of Argument</h1>
<h2 id="boundary-and-routing-costs">Boundary and routing costs</h2>
<p>In <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> spatial dimensions, the
observer boundary <span class="math inline">\(\partial \Omega_d\)</span>
is <span class="math inline">\((d-1)\)</span>-dimensional. For an
observer of characteristic linear size <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, the boundary encoding cost scales as:
<span class="math display">\[L_{\text{boundary}}(d) \sim C_1
R^{\,d-1}.\]</span></p>
<p>However, boundary size alone does not determine optimality. A
critical additional cost arises from the routing of multiple independent
internal processes within the observer.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> denote the number of
concurrent internal flows (e.g. circulation, signaling, energy
transport). Let <span class="math inline">\(C_d(k)\)</span> denote the
minimal description length required to embed <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> disjoint routing channels in <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> dimensions without mutual
interference.</p>
<h2 id="one-dimensional-encodings">One-dimensional encodings</h2>
<p>In <span class="math inline">\(d=1\)</span>, all internal processes
are totally ordered. No two independent channels can bypass each other
without intersection. As a result: <span class="math display">\[C_1(k) =
\infty \quad \text{for } k &gt; 1.\]</span> Thus, one-dimensional
encodings cannot support complex observers.</p>
<h2 id="two-dimensional-encodings">Two-dimensional encodings</h2>
<p>In <span class="math inline">\(d=2\)</span>, boundaries are
one-dimensional curves, and internal routing is constrained by planar
topology. While disjoint routing is possible in principle, each
additional internal channel forces global coordination to avoid
intersections.</p>
<p>As <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> grows, the description
length required to specify non-intersecting routes grows superlinearly:
<span class="math display">\[C_2(k) \sim \exp(k),\]</span> due to
unavoidable crossings, global constraints, and topological fragility.
Small perturbations require large-scale boundary and routing updates,
dramatically increasing MDL cost.</p>
<p>Thus, while two-dimensional observers are not impossible, their
geometric encodings are overwhelmingly inefficient.</p>
<h2 id="three-dimensional-encodings">Three-dimensional encodings</h2>
<p>In <span class="math inline">\(d=3\)</span>, boundaries are
two-dimensional surfaces, and volumetric separation becomes possible.
Independent internal processes can be routed through disjoint tunnels,
layers, and cavities with purely local specification.</p>
<p>As a result: <span class="math display">\[C_3(k) \sim O(k),\]</span>
and the total description length is minimized: <span
class="math display">\[L(G_3) \approx L_{\text{interior}} + C_1 R^2 +
C_2 k.\]</span></p>
<p>Three dimensions are the minimal spatial setting in which:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stable boundaries exist,</p></li>
<li><p>Independent internal flows can bypass each other
locally,</p></li>
<li><p>Boundary modifications remain local rather than global.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="higher-dimensional-encodings">Higher-dimensional encodings</h2>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(d&gt;3\)</span>, routing complexity
does not improve further: <span class="math inline">\(C_d(k) \sim
O(k)\)</span>. However, boundary encoding costs grow rapidly: <span
class="math display">\[L_{\text{boundary}}(d) \sim R^{\,d-1},\]</span>
and additional geometric degrees of freedom must be explicitly
specified, increasing MDL without providing functional benefit.</p>
<p>Thus: <span class="math display">\[L(G_d) &gt; L(G_3) \quad \text{for
} d &gt; 3.\]</span></p>
<h1 id="measure-concentration">Measure Concentration</h1>
<p>Under the MDL-induced measure: <span class="math display">\[\mu(G_d)
\propto e^{-L(G_d)},\]</span> even modest differences in description
length lead to exponential suppression. Since <span
class="math inline">\(L(G_3)\)</span> is minimal, three-dimensional
encodings overwhelmingly dominate the measure.</p>
<p>This explains why observers most likely find themselves embedded in
three spatial dimensions, without invoking anthropic selection or
special physical laws.</p>
<h1 id="related-work-and-novelty">Related Work and Novelty</h1>
<p>The question of why observers find themselves embedded in three
spatial dimensions has been approached from multiple perspectives, but
none capture the information-theoretic, MDL-based argument presented
here.</p>
<p>In physics, dimensional constraints have been considered in the
context of planetary stability, inverse-square laws, and the propagation
of forces <span class="citation"
data-cites="penrose2010 hawking1996nature hawking1988">(Penrose 2010;
Hawking and Penrose 1996; S 1988)</span>. Such arguments are contingent
on the dynamics of specific physical laws and do not generalize to
abstract observers or to the informational structure of existence.</p>
<p>In computational models, one- and two-dimensional cellular automata
have been used to investigate the emergence of localized persistent
structures <span class="citation"
data-cites="zuse1970calculating lloyd2006 deutsch1997">(Zuse 1970; Lloyd
2006; Deutsch 1997)</span>. It is well-known that one-dimensional
automata cannot support multiple disjoint information channels without
interference, and that two-dimensional systems face rapidly growing
coordination complexity for multi-channel routing. Three-dimensional
automata allow volumetric separation and more efficient routing, but
prior work has largely remained confined to specific CA rules and has
not formalized an MDL-based measure over geometric embeddings.</p>
<p>From the perspective of theoretical computer science, the embedding
of graphs and routing of disjoint channels in low-dimensional spaces has
been studied extensively <span class="citation"
data-cites="LiVitanyi Solomonoff1964 Chaitin1975">(Li and Vitányi 2008;
Solomonoff 1964; Chaitin 1975)</span>. These results highlight that 1D
and 2D topologies incur high or even unbounded cost for independent
flows, while 3D embeddings permit linear-cost local routing. However,
previous work treats these results in the context of abstract networks
or circuits, rather than as a general principle governing observer
existence.</p>
<p>Our contribution extends these insights by framing observers as
bounded execution traces with multiple internal processes and a required
inside–outside separation. Geometry is treated not as an optional
representational choice but as a **necessary structural vertex** in a
trinity of analytic (wavefunction), discrete (particles), and geometric
components, each of which is essential to the existence and stability of
the observer. Using a minimum description length (MDL) measure over
possible geometric embeddings, we show that three spatial dimensions are
optimal: they minimize the total description length required to encode
the interior, boundary, and routing of internal processes.
Lower-dimensional embeddings incur exponentially higher description
length, while higher-dimensional embeddings introduce redundant degrees
of freedom without reducing routing complexity. This combination of
information-theoretic formalism, MDL measure, and the trinary observer
structure is, to our knowledge, not present in prior literature and
establishes a new explanatory framework for the emergence of
three-dimensional space for observers.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Three spatial dimensions are not required for observers to exist, but
they are optimal for encoding bounded, persistent observers with
well-defined interior boundaries and multiple concurrent internal
processes.</p>
<p>Under an MDL-based measure over geometric encodings,
three-dimensional space emerges as the overwhelmingly probable setting
for observers.</p>
