id="philosophical-grounding-of-a-theory-of-everything">Philosophical
Grounding of a Theory of Everything</h1>
<p>All existing candidates for a Theory of Everything (ToE) rely on
pre-assumed structures, constraints, or constants that are not
themselves derived from the theory. These assumptions are typically
accepted as primitive and lie outside the explanatory scope of the
framework.</p>
<p>If a theory <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> requires an
external structure <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to fix its
constants, boundary conditions, or domain of validity, then <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> constitutes information not contained
within <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Likewise, if a theory
fails to account for the existence of conscious observers <span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, it omits a central empirical fact:
that observations occur at all.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T + S \neq T\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[T - O \neq T\]</span></p>
<p>A genuine Theory of Everything must therefore be self-contained. It
must not only describe observed regularities, but also explain why
observation itself is possible. In particular, it must clarify what is
being observed, why it has the structure it does, and why observers
arise within it.</p>
<h1 id="the-nature-of-mathematics">The Nature of Mathematics</h1>
<p>We take as a starting point that reality emerges from an abstract,
unconstrained informational substrate—an infinite potential encompassing
all possibilities. Within this substrate, information, mathematics, and
ultimately the laws of physics arise as emergent structures: they exist
because there are no predefined constraints forbidding them.</p>
<p>However, reasoning about mathematics using mathematics encounters
inherent limitations, as demonstrated by Gödel’s incompleteness
theorems. No formal system sufficiently expressive to encode arithmetic
can be both complete and self-verifying. At some level, any argument
about the origin or necessity of mathematics cannot itself be fully
formalized within mathematics.</p>
<p>For the purposes of a self-contained Theory of Everything, we adopt
the minimal operational assumption that all entities, structures, laws,
and observers arise as emergent features of the underlying informational
substrate. No additional axioms or external parameters are required.
This assumption allows mathematics and logic to be treated as emergent
tools rather than pre-given absolutes, while acknowledging that ultimate
meta-mathematical questions cannot be resolved purely within formal
systems.</p>
<h1
id="requirements-for-a-fully-self-contained-theory-of-everything">Requirements
for a Fully Self-Contained Theory of Everything</h1>
<p>We expect a genuine Theory of Everything (ToE) not to be limited to a
catalog of dynamical laws governing pre-assumed entities. Such a theory
would merely shift the explanatory burden to its primitives and leave
unanswered the most fundamental questions concerning existence,
structure, and observation. A fully self-contained ToE must therefore
satisfy a stronger criterion. It must account for the total explanatory
closure of reality without appeal to external meta-theories.</p>
<p>At minimum, such a theory is expected to describe:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>What exists.</strong> The theory must specify its
fundamental ontological substrate. These primitives must not be defined
implicitly by higher-level structures (such as spacetime, particles, or
fields), but instead give rise to them. Any reliance on externally
interpreted mathematical objects undermines self-containment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why structure exists.</strong> Beyond enumerating
entities, the theory must explain why the universe exhibits regularities
in form of laws of physics, rather than being maximally disordered or
trivial. This includes explaining why stable laws, symmetries, and
persistent patterns arise at all.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why the observed structure has the form it does.</strong>
A ToE must justify the emergence of specific structural features—such as
dimensionality, locality, causality, and temporal ordering—rather than
assuming them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Observer Exists</strong> Observation cannot be
treated as an external process. Observers must be describable as
structures internal to the theory, arising from the same principles as
all other phenomena.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why observation is limited.</strong> Equally important,
the theory must account for the fact that observers have bounded access
to truth, predictive power, and global structure. These limitations must
not be imposed ad hoc, but emerge from the same principles that allow
observers to exist in the first place.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A theory satisfying these conditions is self-contained in the strong
sense: it explains not only the universe, but also the possibility and
limitations of explanation itself.</p>
<h1 id="gödel-incompleteness-and-self-contained-theories">Gödel
Incompleteness and Self-Contained Theories</h1>
<p>Gödel’s incompleteness theorems apply to formal axiomatic systems
that are consistent, effectively axiomatized, and sufficiently
expressive to encode arithmetic. Such systems cannot be both complete
and self-verifying. These results place constraints on what can be
proven <em>within</em> a given formalism.</p>
<p>A fully self-contained Theory of Everything is not required to be
formally complete in the Gödelian sense. Its aim is ontological closure
rather than deductive closure: it must explain what exists and why
observers arise within it, not prove every truth expressible in a fixed
language.</p>
<p>However, if observers are modeled as embedded subsystems that reason
using finite, effectively specifiable formalisms, then Gödel-style
incompleteness may arise at the level of observer-accessible
description. In this case, incompleteness is an internal limitation of
observer reasoning rather than a limitation of the underlying theory
itself. Whether such limitations arise depends on how observers and
reasoning are realized within the theory and is not assumed a
priori.</p>
<p>Thus, Gödel incompleteness is neither an obstacle nor a guarantee for
a Theory of Everything; it is a conditional result concerning formal
reasoning by embedded observers.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="the-source-of-matter-and-energy">The Source
of Matter and Energy</h1>
<p>Why is there something rather than nothing? Rather than treating
existence as a metaphysical given, we adopt the minimal assumption that
all logically possible configurations are permitted unless explicitly
constrained.</p>
<p>Under this view, “nothingness” corresponds to a single, highly
specific configuration, while “something” encompasses an unbounded set
of possible states. Within an infinite or unconstrained space of
possibilities, the relative measure of absolute non-existence is zero.
Existence is therefore not exceptional; it is generic.</p>
<p>Matter and energy need not be postulated as fundamental substances.
Instead, they emerge as sub-set within the space of possible
configurations.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="the-fine-tuning-problem">The Fine-Tuning
Problem</h1>
<p>The apparent fine-tuning of physical constants poses a long-standing
problem: why do the laws of physics take values so precisely compatible
with complex structures and conscious life?</p>
<p>If we reject metaphysical selection principles and require a fully
self-contained ToE, then no external agent or mechanism may choose these
values. The only remaining possibility is that the fundamental nature of
reality is not defined by fixed laws, but by an underlying space of
possibilities from which lawful, predictable universes emerge as typical
observational outcomes.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered"
id="finiteness-of-the-observed-universe">Finiteness of the Observed
Universe</h1>
<p>Is the universe finite or infinite? A finite universe would require a
specific bound: for example, a maximum amount of information, energy, or
degrees of freedom. Any such bound immediately raises the question of
its origin: why this value rather than another?</p>
<p>Answering that question would require a meta-theory, leading to an
infinite regress of explanations. To avoid this regress, the most
parsimonious conclusion is that the fundamental substrate of reality is
unbounded.</p>
<p>The finiteness we observe—limited horizons, finite entropy, and
bounded causal domains—is therefore not fundamental. It is an emergent,
observer-relative property arising from local structure within an
infinite underlying reality.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="the-existence-of-an-observer">The Existence
of an Observer</h1>
<p>Any theory intended to describe reality is necessarily conditioned on
the existence of at least one observer, since observation is the means
by which the theory is evaluated. This requirement is not an additional
ontological assumption, but a minimal consistency condition on
admissible models.</p>
<p>The existence of an observer is therefore taken as a given boundary
condition: the theory must permit observer-realizing structures.
However, no further assumptions are made regarding the number, identity,
or distribution of observers. In particular, postulating a single
privileged observer would introduce an unexplained parameter and merely
displace the explanatory burden.</p>
<p>Instead, observer multiplicity, persistence, and typicality are
treated as emergent properties to be derived from the theory’s
underlying informational structure. Whether a universe admits one
observer, many observers, or none at all is a prediction of the theory,
not an axiom.</p>
