<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>Attempts to formulate a conventional theory of quantum gravity have
repeatedly stalled, suggesting that no fundamental theory exists in the
traditional sense.</p>
<h1 id="configurations-paths-and-the-origin-of-time">Configurations,
Paths, and the Origin of Time</h1>
<p>We begin from a minimal and representation-independent premise:
reality is constituted by abstract information alone. There is no
privileged encoding, alphabet, ordering, geometry, probability measure,
or temporal structure at the fundamental level. Any concrete
representation is a matter of convenience rather than ontology.</p>
<h2 id="timeless-configuration-space">Timeless Configuration Space</h2>
<p>For definiteness, we fix a binary representation. With <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> bits of information, the configuration
space is <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{C} = \{0,1\}^n,\]</span>
with cardinality <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{C}| =
2^n\)</span>. Each element <span class="math inline">\(s \in
\mathcal{C}\)</span> is a complete, static configuration.</p>
<p>These configurations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>are unordered,</p></li>
<li><p>all exist equally,</p></li>
<li><p>are ontologically symmetric.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Most configurations resemble unstructured noise; only a vanishing
fraction encode observers or observer-like structures.</p>
<h2 id="permutations-and-movies">Permutations and Movies</h2>
<p>One may conceptually arrange the configurations into complete
orderings. A permutation is a bijection <span
class="math display">\[\sigma : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C},\]</span>
equivalently, a total ordering of all <span
class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span> configurations. The number of such
permutations is <span class="math inline">\((2^n)!\)</span>.</p>
<p>Each permutation may be viewed as a complete “movie” containing every
possible configuration exactly once. This construction is mathematically
valid, but observationally excessive: almost all permutations are
maximally incoherent and devoid of stable structure. Permutations
therefore serve as a conceptual upper bound, not as the fundamental
object of experience.</p>
<h2 id="observer-paths">Observer Paths</h2>
<p>What observers actually experience are not permutations but
<em>paths</em>. An observer path is a finite or semi-infinite sequence
<span class="math display">\[\gamma = (s_1, s_2, \dots, s_T), \quad s_i
\in \mathcal{C},\]</span> with no requirement to visit all
configurations, and with possible repetition.</p>
<p>Observer paths:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>traverse only a tiny subset of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p>preserve informational continuity,</p></li>
<li><p>support memory, self-modeling, and prediction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Every observer path is a subsequence of many permutations, but
permutations are not fundamental. The correct containment relation is:
<span class="math display">\[\text{Observer paths}
\;\subset\;
\text{finite sequences over } \mathcal{C}
\;\subset\;
\text{permutations of } \mathcal{C}.\]</span></p>
<h2 id="time-as-induced-ordering">Time as Induced Ordering</h2>
<p>The configuration space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is timeless. Time is not
fundamental; it is induced as the ordering along an observer path.</p>
<p>Observers traverse short, coherent subpaths through <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>. From regularities along
these paths, they infer a past and extrapolate a future. Cosmology,
dynamics, and causality are therefore models of the path structure, not
of the full configuration space.</p>
<p>This resolves the Wheeler–DeWitt timelessness without introducing
external time or dynamics.</p>
<h2 id="observer-filtering-and-measure">Observer Filtering and
Measure</h2>
<p>Observer is a sub-set of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Among all possible paths, only a vanishing subset include the
observer. These form the observer-compatible set <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{obs}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Observer paths with high stepwise novelty—such as
Boltzmann-brain-like trajectories involving random jumps across
configuration space—are logically and ontologically possible. However,
they carry exponentially suppressed measure.</p>
<p>The distinction is not one of possibility, but of typicality. Paths
that do not compress well have negligible weight under any reasonable
description-length-based measure.</p>
<h1 id="spectral-complexity">Spectral Complexity</h1>
<p>We define <em>Spectral Complexity</em> <span
class="math inline">\(C_{\rm spec}\)</span> as a physically grounded
measure of description length, computed from the spectral decomposition
of observer-relevant configurations. Low <span
class="math inline">\(C_{\rm spec}\)</span> corresponds to smooth,
low-bandwidth, compressible worlds; high <span
class="math inline">\(C_{\rm spec}\)</span> corresponds to chaotic,
high-frequency, uncompressible worlds. The Spectral Minimum Description
Length principle states that observer-compatible worlds are
overwhelmingly drawn from configurations minimizing <span
class="math inline">\(C_{\rm spec}\)</span>, subject to discrete
instantiation (D) and geometric filtering (G). This provides a
computable, continuous, and physically meaningful replacement for
algorithmic Kolmogorov complexity, grounding the emergence of lawful
physics in spectral compressibility.</p>
<h2 id="wavefunction-as-compression">Wavefunction as Compression</h2>
<p>The quantum wavefunction is not a physical medium, nor a dynamical
law. It plays the role of an optimal compression of the ensemble of
observer-compatible paths.</p>
<p>Much like a video codec compresses a family of movies by exploiting
shared structure, the wavefunction encodes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>large ensembles of compatible paths,</p></li>
<li><p>interference as shared substructure in the compressed
description,</p></li>
<li><p>probabilities as relative description weight.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There is no external player, no execution substrate, and no need for
temporal unfolding. The existence of the information itself is
sufficient for lived experience.</p>
<h2 id="why-smooth-compressed-worlds-dominate">Why Smooth Compressed
Worlds Dominate</h2>
<p>Although chaotic and non-compressed observer paths exist, smooth,
compressed, predictable paths dominate measure. Given any fixed amount
of information, that information can be arranged to form smooth observer
movies in compressed format in vastly more ways than it can be arranged
to form highly irregular ones without compression.</p>
<p>A random draw from the ensemble of observer paths is therefore
overwhelmingly likely to yield a lawful, continuous world with
compression artifacts (QM). Our experience of smooth physics is not
imposed by law, but emerges from combinatorial dominance under
compression-weighted selection.</p>
<h2 id="general-relativity">General Relativity</h2>
<p>Emerges as geometric interpretation of information. Information of
the observer, from survivals point of view must not leak out. We must
have well defined boundary of information, and that’s why we have a
sense of 3D body.</p>
<h2 id="constraints-spectral-complexity-and-induction">Constraints,
Spectral Complexity and Induction</h2>
<p>In this framework, both quantum behavior and spacetime geometry
emerge naturally from **observer-centric informational constraints**.
These constraints are captured by a trinity of interdependent
principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Maximal compression (<span
class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>):</strong> Observer histories are
encoded in a form of minimal description length, ensuring that their
evolution is both highly probable and effectively law-like. The
universal wavefunction serves as the optimal compression algorithm for
all underlying degrees of freedom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Minimal discrete instantiation (<span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>):</strong> Observer histories must be
realized at finite resolution. Discrete entities—such as
particles—provide the minimal sufficient representation that faithfully
approximates the underlying continuous wavefunction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stable boundaries (<span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>):</strong> Observers require a
persistent inside–outside distinction to preserve identity and prevent
information leakage. Geometry enforces these boundaries, supplying the
only known mechanism to maintain coherent observer structure across
spacetime.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these principles define the structure of
observer-compatible universes: histories are highly compressible,
discretely instantiated, and geometrically bounded, yielding emergent
laws and spacetime from purely informational constraints.</p>
