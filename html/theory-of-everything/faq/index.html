<h1 class="unnumbered"
id="q-where-did-all-the-matter-in-the-universe-come-from">Q: Where did
all the matter in the universe come from?</h1>
<p>&amp;&amp;<em></em></p>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>This question implicitly assumes a temporal ordering and an external
origin, but both time and causality are emergent properties of observers
within the universe (as established in Paper 1). In the underlying
informational substrate, the universe is abstract and timeless. It
exists because there are no constraints forbidding it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="q-why-does-abstract-information-exist">Q: Why
does abstract information exist?</h1>
<p>&amp;&amp;<em></em></p>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>Asking why there is something abstract rather than nothing is like
asking why “heads” rather than “tails” — both possibilities exist, but
only one can be observed. The observer necessarily finds itself in the
branch that exists.</p>
</div>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="q-does-iame-support-qbism">Q: Does <span
class="math inline">\(IaM^e\)</span> support QBism?</h1>
<p>&amp;&amp;<em></em></p>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p><span>Does the theory support the QBism view that our observations
shape quantum phenomena?</span></p>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>Yes. In <span class="math inline">\(IaM^e\)</span> , the observer is
an informational structure and is most likely to find themselves in
configurations that preserve their reasoning and decision-making
capabilities. Observers with reasoning have a higher probability of
persistence than those without. As a result, reasoning statistically
biases which configurations an observer experiences next. Quantum
mechanics emerges from these informational rules, so it may appear that
observation or decisions “change” the quantum state, even though all
evolution is fully contained within the underlying substrate.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered"
id="q-how-does-gödel-incompleteness-affect-the-theory">Q: How does Gödel
incompleteness affect the theory?</h1>
<p>&amp;&amp;<em></em></p>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>Gödel’s incompleteness theorems constrain formal systems capable of
arithmetic, but a ToE aims for ontological closure, not formal deductive
completeness. Observer reasoning may encounter Gödel-style limits
internally, but these are limitations on embedded observers’ formal
reasoning, not on the underlying informational substrate itself.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="q-are-we-living-in-a-simulation">Q: Are we
living in a simulation?</h1>
<p>&amp;&amp;<em></em></p>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>In the popular formulation, the simulation hypothesis posits an
external simulator operating in a higher-level physical reality. Recent
work has argued that such hypotheses are not fully consistent with
observed features of our universe, placing strong constraints on
externally run simulations <span class="citation"
data-cites="faizal2025">(Faizal et al. 2025)</span>. <span
class="citation" data-cites="Vazza2025SimulationConstraints">(Vazza
2025)</span> approaches the simulation hypothesis from a very different
perspective, with astrophysical constraints. Regardless of the technical
details, this approach merely shifts the explanatory burden: one must
then explain the origin and laws of the simulator itself. In this
framework, such meta-theories are rejected. A genuine Theory of
Everything cannot rely on an external system, as a “theory of everything
minus the simulator” is not a theory of everything. Instead, we assume
informational ontological equivalence: simulated and non-simulated
realities are not ontologically distinct. The universe is not running
<em>on</em> something else; rather, all structures, including observers
and apparent physical laws, arise within a single abstract informational
substrate. In this sense, the question of whether we are “in a
simulation” is ill-posed.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered"
id="q-is-the-recursive-simulation-hypothesis-supported-within-the-theory">Q:
Is the recursive simulation hypothesis supported within the theory?</h1>
<p>&amp;&amp;<em></em></p>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>Yes, but only in a restricted and precisely defined sense.</p>
<p>Within the theory, observers are informational structures. Any such
structure capable of reasoning can, in principle, construct formal
systems, Turing machines, and simulations of itself. This has already
occurred: humans have defined universal computation and have begun
simulating simplified versions of biological, cognitive, and physical
processes. Since biological information (including DNA) can be encoded
digitally without loss of information, simulated humans can be axiomatic
copies of real humans at the informational level.</p>
<p>These sub-simulations do not require a separate ontological
substrate. They correspond simply to different configurations within the
same underlying informational space (e.g., subsets of <span
class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span>). In this limited sense, recursive
simulation is supported.</p>
<p>However, the theory places a fundamental constraint on unbounded
recursive simulation: <strong>entropy</strong>.</p>
<p>While it is logically possible to define a simulation of observers,
it is informationally expensive to <em>realize</em> one. Extracting,
encoding, and maintaining the information required to faithfully
describe even a single human genome is already nontrivial. Scaling this
to billions of humans, each composed of billions of cells, embedded in a
universe containing astronomical numbers of particles and interactions,
rapidly exhausts available informational resources.</p>
<p>As a result, recursive simulations necessarily degrade. They must
either:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>omit detail,</p></li>
<li><p>compress aggressively (thereby losing fidelity),</p></li>
<li><p>restrict scope, or</p></li>
<li><p>terminate.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>While recursive simulation is internally consistent with the theory,
its informational cost is high. Consequently, deep, high-fidelity nested
simulations are unlikely to persist. The theory favors shallow or
short-lived recursions, yet this contradicts our current empirical
evidence.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="q-why-do-we-die">Q: Why do we die?</h1>
<p>&amp;&amp;<em></em></p>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>The phenomenon of death can be understood in terms of the information
content of an observer. As time progresses, an observer accumulates
information in the form of memories, knowledge, and physical structure.
During early life, this accumulation typically increases the probability
of persistence: improved reasoning, learned skills, and adaptive
behaviors make it more likely that the observer continues to exist.
However, as the information content grows, the number of future
configurations compatible with the continued existence of that observer
decreases. Eventually, the set of configurations becomes exhausted, and
the observer ceases to exist. In this sense, death arises naturally from
the finite combinatorial possibilities available to complex
informational structures.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered"
id="q-does-the-theory-explain-why-the-expansion-rate-of-the-universe-is-so-close-to-the-dividing-line">Q:
Does the theory explain why the expansion rate of the universe is so
close to the dividing line</h1>
<p>&amp;&amp;<em></em></p>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>Conditional on entropy increasing and on typical emergence, observers
are overwhelmingly likely to find themselves at the entropy value where
microstructure count is maximal — which corresponds to a near-critical
expansion regime.</p>
