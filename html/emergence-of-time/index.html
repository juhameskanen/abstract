<p>Building on the ontological equivalence of informational
configurations established in Paper I, we derive a model of the universe
based on ordering of these configurations. We identify an emergent
<em>ordinal time</em> within the static Wheeler–DeWitt multiverse.
Observer-experienced reality is then dominated by histories that
minimize description length providing a unified mechanism for the
emergence of time, unitarity, quantum probabilities, and the suppression
of divergences. Observers most likely find them from maximally
compressed paths, as those are numerously dominant and hence most
probable.</p>

<h1 id="ontological-framework">Ontological Framework</h1>
<p>We consider the universe as a static informational object <span
class="math inline">\(U\)</span> consisting of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> bits. All physically and
observer-relevant structures are encoded within this data. Observers are
particular configurations <span class="math inline">\(O \subset
U\)</span> whose internal structure allows them to encode a sense of
temporal ordering.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is atemporal, time
cannot be fundamental. We define an observer’s experience of time as the
<em>ordering of configurations</em> that preserves the internal
correlations of <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>. Let <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{C}(O) = \{\pi : \pi \text{ is a
permutation of configurations in } U \text{ consistent with } O
\}\]</span> denote the set of orderings compatible with the observer’s
internal structure. Only permutations in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}(O)\)</span> correspond to possible
temporal experiences for <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>.</p>
<p>In this sense, the universe is a timeless informational structure.
Dynamics emerge from the correlations inherent in the static data, as
experienced by observers through specific orderings of configurations.
Arbitrary orderings that destroy these correlations are structurally
incompatible with observer experience.</p>
<h1 id="emergence-of-wave-like-structure-from-compressibility">Emergence
of Wave-Like Structure from Compressibility</h1>
<p>Among all observer-consistent orderings <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}(O)\)</span>, those that are highly
compressible are combinatorially dominant. Let <span
class="math inline">\(K(\pi)\)</span> denote the Kolmogorov complexity
of a permutation <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. Then <span
class="math display">\[\#\{\pi \in \mathcal{C}(O) \,|\, K(\pi) \text{
minimal}\} \gg
\#\{\pi \in \mathcal{C}(O) \,|\, K(\pi) \text{ high}\}.\]</span> This
dominance is purely structural: it reflects the number of permutations
consistent with observer continuity, not any stochastic selection or
prior. Our Python simulations confirm that, across a wide range of
ensembles, compressible permutations vastly outnumber incompressible
ones.</p>
<p>The wavefunction arises as the minimal linear encoding that preserves
correlations across these compressible orderings. Superposition
naturally appears because linear combinations of compressible orderings
remain compressible and maintain the correlations necessary for
observer-consistent experience. Interference phenomena reflect the
overlap between different orderings within this linear encoding.</p>
<p>The effective Born weights emerge from the combinatorial multiplicity
of orderings corresponding to particular outcomes. Specifically, the
squared amplitude of a component in the linear encoding reflects the
relative number of permutations consistent with that outcome. Observers
therefore experience quantum probabilities not as fundamental
randomness, but as a direct consequence of the structural abundance of
compressible, observer-consistent orderings.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The universe is a static informational substrate; time is an
emergent property of observers embedded within it.</p></li>

configurations compatible with their internal structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Maximal compressibility combinatorially dominates among
observer-consistent orderings, explaining the smoothness of observed
physics.</p></li>

encodings reflecting the multiplicity of compressible orderings, without

<h1 id="wheeler-dewitt">Wheeler-DeWitt</h1>
<p>We adopt the canonical formulation of quantum gravity, in which the
universal state <span
class="math inline">\(\Psi[h_{ij}(\mathbf{x}),\phi(\mathbf{x})]\)</span>
satisfies the Wheeler–DeWitt (WdW) equation <span
class="math display">\[\hat{H}\Psi = 0,\]</span> and contains no
fundamental time parameter <span class="citation"
data-cites="DeWitt1967">(DeWitt 1967)</span>. We interpret <span
class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span> in an Everettian sense as a static
superposition over all admissible 3-geometries and matter field
configurations: <span class="math display">\[\ket{\Psi} = \sum_i c_i
\ket{h_i,\phi_i}.\]</span></p>
<p>In this view, the universe is a timeless informational structure. Any
notion of dynamics must arise from correlations internal to <span
class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span>, rather than from external temporal
evolution.</p>
<h1 id="spectral-selection-principle">Spectral Selection Principle</h1>
<p>Among all relational histories consistent with the universal state
<span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span>, observer-experienced
permutation is dominated by histories whose total description length is
minimal.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> denote a relational
history induced by a particular factorization and ordering of
configurations. The relative weight of <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[P(S)
\propto 2^{-K(S)},\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(K(S)\)</span> is the Kolmogorov complexity (or
minimal description length) of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>

Structure</h1>
<h2 id="wavefunction-as-optimal-encoding">Wavefunction as Optimal
Encoding</h2>
<p>We assume the wavefunction <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>
emerges as the minimal encoding of reality with an observer.</p>
<p>Highly irregular configurations require longer descriptions and are
suppressed, leading to an effective low-frequency, smooth structure.</p>
<h2 id="unitarity-from-informational-stability">Unitarity from
Informational Stability</h2>
<p>Persistence of observer identity requires that successive encodings
preserve total information content. In a linear representation space,
this restricts admissible transformations to norm-preserving maps.
Continuous norm preservation uniquely selects unitary evolution, with a
Hermitian generator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span>,
yielding <span class="math display">\[i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial
t}\psi = \hat{H}\psi.\]</span></p>
<h1 id="the-born-rule-from-spectral-optimality">The Born Rule from
Spectral Optimality</h1>
<p>We now strengthen the derivation of the Born rule by identifying it
as the <em>unique decoding rule</em> compatible with Spectral Selection
Principle and observer persistence.</p>
<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\psi \in \mathcal{H}\)</span> be the
observer’s compressed encoding of relational correlations. A probability
rule assigns to each outcome <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> a
weight <span class="math display">\[P(i) = f(|\psi_i|),\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a non-negative function.</p>
<p>We seek the unique <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> compatible
with the following physically motivated constraints.</p>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
<h4 id="c1-additivity-under-coarse-graining">(C1) Additivity under
coarse-graining</h4>
<p>If outcomes <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> are grouped, <span
class="math display">\[P(i \cup j) = P(i) + P(j).\]</span></p>
<h4 id="c2-composition-consistency">(C2) Composition consistency</h4>
<p>For independent subsystems <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, <span
class="math display">\[P(i_A, j_B) = P(i_A) P(j_B).\]</span></p>
<h4 id="c3-basis-invariance">(C3) Basis invariance</h4>
<p>Probabilities must be invariant under unitary change of basis.</p>
<h4 id="c4-reconstruction-optimality">(C4) Reconstruction
optimality</h4>
<p>The decoding rule must minimize mean squared reconstruction error
between encoded and decoded histories. This is the unique optimal
decoder for finite observers using lossy compression.</p>
<h2 id="uniqueness-of-the-squared-norm">Uniqueness of the Squared
Norm</h2>
<p>Constraints (C1) and (C2) imply that <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> must be quadratic in amplitude
magnitude: <span class="math display">\[f(x) = k x^2.\]</span></p>
<p>Constraint (C3) excludes dependence on phase or basis-dependent
quantities.</p>
<p>Constraint (C4) selects the <span class="math inline">\(L^2\)</span>
norm uniquely: among all <span class="math inline">\(L^p\)</span> norms,
only <span class="math inline">\(p = 2\)</span> yields linear
projections, orthogonality preservation, and stable error minimization
under compression.</p>
<p>Normalization fixes <span class="math inline">\(k = 1\)</span>,
yielding <span class="math display">\[P(i) = |\psi_i|^2.\]</span></p>
<h4 id="conclusion.">Conclusion.</h4>
<p>The Born rule is not an independent axiom, but the unique probability
assignment compatible with spectral compression, compositional
consistency, and observer persistence in Hilbert space.</p>
<h2 id="physical-meaning-of-the-born-weight">Physical Meaning of the
Born Weight</h2>
<p>Multiplicity explains why the squared norm (<span
class="math inline">\(P = |\psi|^2\)</span>) is the correct measure
selected by the optimal decoding rule.</p>
<h3 id="lemma-quadratic-scaling-in-linear-encoding">Lemma: Quadratic
Scaling in Linear Encoding</h3>
<p>In any linear wave-based encoding scheme, the number of
distinguishable microstates <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>
consistent with a macroscopic wave constraint scales with the squared
norm of the amplitude. Following Parseval’s Theorem, the total energy
(or informational "power") of a signal in Hilbert space is: <span
class="math display">\[E = \int | \psi(x) |^2 dx\]</span> In our
framework, "Power" is equivalent to the **bandwidth of the execution
trace**. A higher amplitude <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
provides a quadratically larger state-space volume for microstate
permutations that remain consistent with the observer’s template. Thus,
the multiplicity of observer-instances is <span class="math inline">\(M
\propto |\psi|^2\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="the-universal-prior-and-self-locating-uncertainty">The Universal
Prior and Self-Locating Uncertainty</h3>
<p>Applying a universal prior (Solomonoff) over the ensemble <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>, the probability <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> of an observer finding themselves in
state <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is defined by its
Kolmogorov Complexity <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{K}(S)\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[P(S) \propto 2^{-\mathcal{K}(S) + c}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is a constant determined by
the choice of universal Turing machine. This represents
<em>self-locating uncertainty</em>: the observer is not "choosing" a
path, but is statistically distributed across all consistent bit-string
permutations.</p>
<h3 id="derivation-of-the-born-weight">Derivation of the Born
Weight</h3>
<p>By combining the multiplicity of the linear wave-template with the
universal prior, the relative measure of observer density across
configuration space is: <span class="math display">\[P(\text{Alice} \in
\psi) = \frac{|\psi|^2}{\int |\psi|^2 dx}\]</span> This normalization
reflects the relative density of observer-instances, not a stochastic
collapse of the wavefunction.</p>
<h3 id="the-vanishing-measure-of-divergences">The Vanishing Measure of
Divergences</h3>
<p>This derivation provides a natural "soft cutoff" for the infinities
of Quantum Field Theory. While divergent states exist mathematically,
their description length <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{K}\)</span> explodes. Since: <span
class="math display">\[\lim_{\mathcal{K} \to \infty} 2^{-\mathcal{K}} =
0\]</span> the measure of observers inhabiting divergent branches is
zero. Physical laws appear smooth and renormalized because only finite,
highly-compressible (low-<span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{K}\)</span>) branches possess sufficient
multiplicity resulting high probability of existence.</p>
<h1 id="singularities-and-renormalization">Singularities and
Renormalization</h1>
<p>Configurations corresponding to classical singularities in GR, or
ultraviolet divergences in QFT possess vanishing or ill-defined
informational structure. Such states require maximal description length
and are exponentially suppressed under SSP. Their observational
probability is zero.</p>
<p>Renormalization in quantum field theory arises as a direct
consequence: high-frequency modes are incompressible and do not
contribute to dominant observer-compatible histories. Effective field
theories are therefore maximal-compressibility approximations to the
static informational substrate.</p>
<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>Spacetime geometry, time, quantum probabilities, and classicality
emerge as features of typical correlations within a timeless universal
state. Singularities and divergences mark the boundaries of
informational accessibility, not physical breakdowns.</p>
<p>The Spectral Selection Principle shifts the explanatory burden from
fundamental dynamics to informational selection, providing a unified
resolution of the problem of time, the origin of quantum probabilities,
and the absence of observable infinities.</p>
