<p>We present a constructive proof-of-concept demonstrating that
classical geodesic paths on a curved surface can be recovered by
minimizing an informational cost functional defined in bitstring.
Specifically, we compare Euclidean action minimization with minimization
of a <em>phase-coherent spectral entropy</em> computed from local
bit-encoded wavefunction segments. We interpret the wavefunction as a
<em>minimal description of nature</em>, compressing the underlying
information such that smoother, simpler waveforms dominate statistical
measure. Without assuming any prior equivalence between geometric and
informational principles, we show that both methods select nearly
identical paths across a range of noisy, nontrivial geometries. This
result supports the hypothesis that classical spacetime dynamics may
emerge from an underlying informational principle.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Here, we explore the notion that the wavefunction itself is a
<em>compression system for the universe</em>: any set of information can
be arranged into many possible wavefunctions, and simple, smooth
wavefunctions admit vastly more representations. Thus, smoother,
lower-entropy wavefunctions dominate statistical measure, realizing a
form of minimal-description principle akin to Kolmogorov complexity but
with well-defined size and smoothness constraints.</p>
<p>We investigate whether a purely informational cost functional,
defined independently of geometry, can recover classical geodesic
behavior. Our approach is algorithmic and discrete: paths are selected
step-by-step by minimizing <em>phase-coherent spectral entropy</em> over
local execution traces. Remarkably, we find strong agreement between the
two resulting paths, suggesting that minimal descriptions naturally
encode geodesic structure.</p>
<h1 id="geometric-setup">Geometric Setup</h1>
<p>We consider a two-dimensional spatial domain embedded in a
three-dimensional height field, representing a curved metric surface.
The surface is constructed as a superposition of Gaussian hills and
valleys with added stochastic noise. Let <span
class="math inline">\(\phi(x,y)\)</span> denote the surface height. The
classical Euclidean action for a path <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> proceeding in the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> direction is approximated locally by
<span class="math display">\[I_E \approx \sum_x \left( \nabla_x \phi
\right)^2,\]</span> where the gradient is discretized on a grid. At each
step, the next path position is chosen from a local neighborhood to
minimize the incremental contribution to <span
class="math inline">\(I_E\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="informational-action-as-minimal-description">Informational
Action as Minimal Description</h1>
<p>We propose that the classical trajectory emerges from an underlying
principle of <em>Minimal Description</em>. In this framework, the
physical path is not determined by geometric distance, but by the
efficiency with which the bit-encoded substrate can represent the state.
We define the informational action <span
class="math inline">\(S_I\)</span> as the integral of an informational
Lagrangian <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_I\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S_I = \int_{\gamma} \mathcal{L}_I(\Psi,
\dot{\Psi}) \, dt = \int_{\gamma} \left[ \mathcal{H}(\Psi) + \alpha \,
\mathcal{D}(\Psi, \dot{\Psi}) \right] dt\]</span></p>
<p>where the Lagrangian is partitioned into two fundamental terms: the
spectral complexity and the phase incoherence.</p>
<h2 id="spectral-entropy-mathcalh">Spectral Entropy (<span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}\)</span>)</h2>
<p>The first term, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}\)</span>,
quantifies the informational cost to describe the local state. For a
discrete bit-segment <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span>, we
compute the normalized power spectral density (PSD) via a real Fourier
transform. The probability <span class="math inline">\(p_k\)</span> of a
frequency mode <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is given by: <span
class="math display">\[p_k = \frac{|A_k|^2}{\sum_j |A_j|^2}\]</span> The
spectral entropy is defined as: <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{H}
= -\sum_{k} p_k \log_2 p_k\]</span> Lower entropy corresponds to
smoother waveforms, representing a more compressed minimal
description.</p>
<h2 id="phase-incoherence-and-quantum-infidelity-mathcald">Phase
Incoherence and Quantum Infidelity (<span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span>)</h2>
<p>To ensure the continuity of the emergent description, we introduce a
transport cost <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span>. This
term penalizes rapid phase slips between consecutive execution traces.
We utilize the complex inner product to measure the overlap between the
current state <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_t\)</span> and the
candidate state <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_{t+dt}\)</span> in
Hilbert space: <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{D} = 1 -
\frac{|\langle \Psi_t | \Psi_{t+dt} \rangle|}{\|\Psi_t\|
\|\Psi_{t+dt}\|}\]</span> This formulation is mathematically equivalent
to the <em>Fubini-Study metric</em>, defining the infinitesimal distance
between points in projective Hilbert space. It effectively imparts
informational inertia, favoring descriptions that maintain
phase-stability over time. The purpose is to find the optimal
wavefunction (maximal compression).</p>
<h1 id="path-finding-algorithm">Path-Finding Algorithm</h1>
<p>Both methods employ the same local path-finding structure. Starting
from a fixed boundary condition, the path advances column by column. At
each step, three candidate positions are evaluated, and the one
minimizing the respective cost functional is selected. No geometric
information is used in the informational method; likewise, no
informational quantities appear in the Euclidean action.</p>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<p>Across multiple randomly generated surfaces, the paths selected by
Euclidean action minimization and minimal description (QBitwave) are
nearly identical. Incorporating phase coherence (<span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span>) significantly improves
alignment, especially in regions with ambiguous local gradients.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="systematic-noise-study">Systematic Noise
Study</h2>
<p>A parameter sweep shows that at low noise, both measures correlate
strongly. As noise increases, Euclidean action rises monotonically,
while the informational action exhibits a saturation effect due to
finite-resolution encoding. This divergence illustrates that
informational cost imposes natural cutoffs, reflecting the dominance of
smooth wavefunctions as minimal descriptions.</p>

increases monotonically with noise. The phase-coherent spectral entropy
(blue) initially tracks the action but saturates at higher noise levels
due to finite-resolution bit encoding and phase-stability effects. The
dashed line represents the compressibility measure of the informational
path, highlighting the minimal-program dominance of smooth, low-entropy
wavefunctions.</figcaption>

<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>The observed correspondence suggests that classical geodesics may be
understood as paths of minimum informational description. The
minimal-description perspective implies that simpler wavefunctions
dominate measure and naturally align with Euclidean geodesics.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>We have demonstrated that minimizing phase-coherent spectral entropy
can recover classical geodesic paths.</p>
<p>This result, together with the <strong>Entropy-Singularity
Lemma</strong>, represents two sides of the same coin: regions of
vanishing entropy contain no microstructure, while entropy-minimizing
trajectories naturally avoid high-entropy, singular configurations.</p>
<p>Taken together, these principles imply that spacetime singularities
and divergences are automatically suppressed by the informational
structure of the universe.</p>
