The conclusions derived here concern ontological equivalence, substrate independence, and the observer-relative nature of time and experience.
Simulations are useful when a theory predicts observable global structure—motion, growth, collapse, thresholds, or phase transitions.
This theory predicts none.
Conscious observers leave no global statistical signature.
Execution order has no ontological status.
A static set of information (e.g. a bitstring) can encode arbitrarily many coherent observer-relative worlds.
Any simulation attempting to “show” these claims would necessarily introduce either a privileged execution order, 
a substrate-dependent mechanism, or a detectable global marker of consciousness.
All three would contradict the theory itself.

This simulation visualizes a collapsing dust cloud in a Schwarzschild spacetime and tracks the system's entropy over time. Although numerical instabilities and the breakdown of GR prevent the simulation from reaching the final state, the execution trace of the simulating computer demonstrates a monotonic decrease in Shannon entropy. By extrapolating this trend to the limit we conclude that the singularity corresponds to a zero-information state.

Simulation tracking a collapsing dust cloud within a Kerr (rotating) spacetime. While the resulting singularity is geometrically ring-like, the execution trace of the simulating computer demonstrates the same monotonic decrease in Shannon entropy observed in the Schwarzschild case. We conclude that even a ring singularity represents a zero-information state: an entropy-null region where the geometric structure lacks the informational capacity to sustain energy, particles, or gravitational influence. As the system trends toward zero information, the available microstates vanish; consequently, the probability of any particle state manifesting within the singularity is zero.

In the time-reversed scenario, we observe the unfolding of spacetime driven by increasing entropy. The system expands rapidly during the initial low-entropy phase, mirroring the early universe's growth. However, as the bitstring approaches maximum entropy, the expansion rate naturally decelerates, following the saturation curve toward equilibrium. In this model, the 'force' of expansion is an entropic drift that stabilizes as information density reaches its peak, suggesting a universe that matures toward a smooth, high-entropy limit rather than an accelerated heat death.

This simulation demonstrates the emergence of physical phenomena from an information-theoretic foundation. By assuming Gaussian blobs as observer-models, quantum interference and an emergent pull force arise as the most statistically probable outcomes.

    </td><td valign="top">
Informationally complex Gaussian distributions exhibit effective gravitational attraction and inertial persistence as emergent properties of compression-optimal observer trajectories.
Smooth, predictable observer paths admit maximal compression and therefore dominate the measure of realizable histories from which Gaussian structures are statistically expected to arise.
