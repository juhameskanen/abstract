# The Abstract Universe Project (AUP) 

## Purpose

Many today have given up on the Theory of Everything. This project is not among them. We believe we can not only solve *how* the universe works, but also *what* it truly is.  

This project is a playground for serious physics, Python, LaTeX, and the GitHub ecosystem—where rigor meets curiosity and joy. Code, simulations, and explorations tackle deep questions about reality, entropy, and abstract structures, all while having fun along the way (YAML excluded!) 

## Goal

To explore the deep nature of reality, and to develop a formal theory of everything (ToE) in which physical universe emerges without pre-assumed laws. The project encompasses both rigorous mathematical exposition and computational simulations that illustrate and validate key theoretical claims. 


## Contents

* [Pages](https://juhameskanen.github.io/abstract/) – HTML and PDF versions of all papers
* [Papers](https://github.com/juhameskanen/abstract) – LaTeX and python simulation source code for all papers
* [CHANGELOG ➡](CHANGELOG.md) – Record of updates, improvements, and new simulations
* [LICENSE ➡](LICENCE.md) – Licence 



## Continuous Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated builds:

* [![Build and Upload PDFs](https://github.com/juhameskanen/abstract/actions/workflows/build-pdf.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/juhameskanen/abstract/actions/workflows/build-pdf.yml) – Builds and uploads the latest PDF versions of the papers
* [![Build and Deploy HTML (GitHub Pages)](https://github.com/juhameskanen/abstract/actions/workflows/build-pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/juhameskanen/abstract/actions/workflows/build-pages.yml) – Generates and deploys HTML versions of papers to GitHub Pages


## Wiki

The [project wiki](https://github.com/juhameskanen/abstract/wiki) contains:

* Detailed descriptions of simulations
* Implementation notes and algorithms
* Research notes and derivations
* Discussion of ongoing and planned chapters


## The Current State

**Under Construction** - material is being collected from other resources and converted from different formats to github ecosystem.

Many simulations and chapters are in draft stage; behavior may be updated frequently based on the current phase of authorial chaos. 

This is a research-in-progress project. Many simulations and chapters are in draft and their content evolves frequently as research progresses.



## Contributing

Contributions are generally not expected, but welcomed anyway, especially:

* Additional simulations demonstrating theoretical claims
* Corrections, clarifications, or expansions of draft chapters
* Documentation improvements

Please follow standard GitHub workflow: fork → branch → pull request. Ensure all code additions are well-documented.
