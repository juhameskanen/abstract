# The Abstract Universe Project (AUP) 

## The Goal

This is an ongoing research and simulation framework exploring the deep nature of reality. It develops a formal theory of everything (ToE) in which physical universe emerges without pre-assumed laws. The project encompasses both rigorous mathematical exposition and computational simulations that illustrate and validate key theoretical claims.


## Contents

* [Pages](https://juhameskanen.github.io/abstract/) – HTML and PDF versions of all papers
* [Papers](https://github.com/juhameskanen/abstract) – LaTeX and python simulation source code for all papers
* [CHANGELOG ➡](CHANGELOG.md) – Record of updates, improvements, and new simulations


## Purpose

The Abstract Universe Project aims to:

1. Formulate a **theory of everything**
2. Demonstrate, via simulations, how only two minimal principles give rise to universes with physics.
3. Provide a **rigorous, testable framework** for a Theory of Everything (ToE) that unifies gravity and quantum mechanics as manifestations of information structures

This is a research-in-progress project. Many simulations and book chapters are in draft form and will be refined over time.


## Continuous Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated builds:

* [![Build and Upload PDFs](https://github.com/juhameskanen/abstract/actions/workflows/build-pdf.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/juhameskanen/abstract/actions/workflows/build-pdf.yml) – Builds and uploads the latest PDF versions of the papers
* [![Build and Deploy HTML (GitHub Pages)](https://github.com/juhameskanen/abstract/actions/workflows/build-pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/juhameskanen/abstract/actions/workflows/build-pages.yml) – Generates and deploys HTML versions of papers to GitHub Pages


## Wiki

The [project wiki](https://github.com/juhameskanen/abstract/wiki) contains:

* Detailed descriptions of simulations
* Implementation notes and algorithms
* Research notes and derivations
* Discussion of ongoing and planned chapters


> Note: Many simulations and chapters are in draft stage; behavior may be updated frequently.


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially:

* Additional simulations demonstrating theoretical claims
* Corrections, clarifications, or expansions of draft chapters
* Documentation improvements

Please follow standard GitHub workflow: fork → branch → pull request. Ensure all code additions are well-documented.
