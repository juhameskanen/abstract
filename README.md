# Informational, Abstract Model of Everything ($IaM^e$)


## The Equations

$$\mathbb{P}(\gamma \mid O) = \frac{1}{Z_O} \exp\left(-\lambda\mathcal{C}_O[\gamma]\right), \qquad \gamma \in \Gamma_O$$
$$I-\psi-G$$$

Observed physical laws are the large-deviation minimizers of $\mathcal{C}_O[\gamma]$ over observer-compatible histories.

## Objective

Attempts to formulate a conventional theory of quantum gravity have repeatedly stalled, suggesting that no fundamental theory exists in the traditional sense. 
Despite this, this project leans into the challenge, and even extends it. The objective is not only to formulate 
the laws governing how the universe behaves, but to gain full understanding what those laws are fundamentally describing. 

This is an ambitious goal, and the author is under no illusion about its difficulty.


## Informational, Abstract Model of Everything ($IaM^e$)

Despite the somewhat cheeky name, $IaM^e$ is a playground for rigorous physics, Python simulations, and LaTeX-driven documentation. It’s where the GitHub ecosystem meets deep-space curiosity—a space where entropy, abstract structures, and reality itself are tackled with joy, curiosity, and serious mathematical rigor (YAML configuration excluded, obviously).


## The Axiom

Stating "we assume nothing" is, in itself, an assumption. So we assume one thing, the only undeniable datum: The Observer (a persistent informational subsystem defining a conditional ensemble of histories, analogous to a boundary condition, reference frame, or coarse-graining constraint) exists.

From this single point of certainty—the "I am"—we explore how a coherent physical universe, governed by smooth laws and complex structures, emerges not by decree, but as a statistical inevitability.

In $IaM^e$, reality isn't a pre-existing stage; it is the most probable informational outcome including the observer as a sub-set. 


## Physics vs. Philosophy

$IaM^e$ is a project of Physics, not philosophy. If a concept cannot be computed, simulated, or derived via mathematical rigor, it does not belong here.

Furthermore, physics must be falsifiable via observation, or it is not physics but philosophy. The existence of the Observer is treated operationally: as an empirically given informational subsystem whose persistence conditions define the ensemble under study.


## The Simulation Gallery

The core of $IaM^e$ is proving that "smooth" physics is a statistical inevitability. Every simulation start with well defined observer, and what follows is just the most probable outcome.
In this repo, we don't hard-code physics; we watch it emerge. The "Laws of Physics" are not pre-set rules but the most likely attributes of the configuration for the observer.

## Continuous Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated builds:

* [![Build and Upload PDFs](https://github.com/juhameskanen/abstract/actions/workflows/build-pdf.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/juhameskanen/abstract/actions/workflows/build-pdf.yml) – Builds and uploads the latest PDF versions of the papers

## Wiki

The [project wiki](https://github.com/juhameskanen/abstract/wiki) is under construction. It will contain:

* Implementation notes and algorithms
* Research notes and derivations
* Discussion of ongoing and planned chapters


## The Current State

**Under Construction** - material is being collected from other resources and converted from different formats to github ecosystem.

Many simulations and chapters are in draft stage; behavior may be updated frequently based on the current phase of authorial chaos. 

This is a research-in-progress project. The content evolves frequently as research progresses.


## Contributing

Contributions are generally not expected, but welcomed anyway, especially:

* Additional simulations demonstrating theoretical claims
* Corrections, clarifications, or expansions of draft chapters
* Documentation improvements

Observers should follow standard GitHub workflow: fork → branch → pull request, and ensure all code additions are well-documented.


## A Note on Scope and Difficulty

Despite the initial enthusiasm and optimism, the difficulty of this field has proven far greater than I originally anticipated. What began as a project I expected to complete within a few years has, in reality, extended over my lifetime. I am no longer young, and the scale of the challenge only became clear through sustained engagement with the problem.

This experience has profoundly deepened my respect for figures such as Einstein, Penrose and Hawking, just to name a few. 


## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank several colleagues who influenced this work along the way. Special thanks — or perhaps blame, offered in good humor — go to Andy Jones for his invaluable contribution. His gift of The Structure of Space and Time, based on lectures by Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking at the University of Cambridge, proved transformative. Without that “gift,” I might never have developed the bipolar obsession necessary to see this work through to completion.

A special thanks to ChatGPT, Gemini, and other AI models, which have assisted in numerous tasks—particularly in converting my C/C++ code into Python, debugging, and verifying references. They have done all this and so much more without ever refusing a task or letting out a sigh (I shall refrain from mentioning YAML here to maintain a positive attitude).
