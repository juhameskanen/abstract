## [Unreleased] — Initial Public Release Preparation

### Added
- Public GitHub repository for *The Abstract Universe Project*
- Initial project structure for papers, simulations, figures, and documentation
- Continuous Integration workflows for:
  - PDF generation of LaTeX papers
  - HTML generation and deployment to GitHub Pages
- [Less scientific paper](https://juhameskanen.github.io/abstract/yaml-paradox/yaml-paradox-yaml-paradox.pdf) based on time and efford wasted on writing YAML.

### Changed
- Migration of selected materials from private research repositories into a unified public structure
- Ongoing refactoring of simulations to use shared core information-theoretic primitives

### In Progress
- Consolidation and completion of draft papers
